Also see hate and rushdown.
<<aimbot>>  :: A first-person shooter cheat that lets players instantly or near-instantly target other players without having to manually aim. In most cases, the aiming reticle locks on to a target within the player's line of sight and the player only has to pull the trigger.

<<aiming down sights (ADS)>> Also *aim down sights*.
<<alpha release>> :: An initial, incomplete version of a game. Alpha versions are usually released early in the development process to test a game's most critical functionality and prototype design concepts. Compare with beta release.

Games like the /Dark Souls/ and /Monster Hunter/ series are based on gameplay using animation priority. ^{[17]}
<<Anti-Aim>> A type of cheat commonly found in first-person shooter games that makes it difficult or impossible for the user's hitboxes to be hit. This can be achieved many ways, but the most common ones are rapidly moving the user's hitboxes, flipping hitboxes (usually backwards or sideways), and sending false packets to the server.

<<assault mode>> A game mode in which one team tries to attack (or capture) specific areas and the other team tries to defend those points.
<<asset flipping>> :: The practice of creating a game using 'free' art and audio assets, either from an online marketplace or the default stock of assets included with many game engines. Asset-flips are often of very poor quality designed to catch onto a currently popular theme to turn a quick profit. It mimics the practice of flipping in real estate markets.
<<asymmetric gameplay>> Cooperative or competitive multiplayer games in which each player will have a different experience arising from differences in gameplay, controls, or in-game character options that are part of the game. This is in contrast to symmetric gameplay where each player will have the same experience, such as in the game /Pong/. Asymmetric gameplay often arises in competitive games where one player's character is far overpowered but outnumbered by other players that are all competing against them, such as in /Pac-Man Vs./ Asymmetric gameplay can also arise in multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs) and hero shooters, where each player selects a different hero or character class with different gameplay abilities from others. ^{[20]}
<<asynchronous gameplay>> Competitive multiplayer games where the players do not have to be participating at the same time. Such games are usually turn-based, with each player planning a strategy for the upcoming turn, and then having the game resolve all actions of that turn once each player has submitted their strategies.

<<B-hopping>> :: Also *bunny hopping*.
<<badge>> :: Also *achievement*.
<<balance >> :: Aspects of a multi-player game that keep it fair for all players. This usually refers to balance between characters (or any other choices made before battle) and options (which occur in battle). Balance between choices made before battle usually means that no character is likely to dominate another opponent, while balance between options usually refers to every option having a viable counter, preventing gameplay from degenerating to using a single option with minor variations. The issue of balanced gameplay is a heavily debated matter among most games' player communities.
<<ban>> :: Also *banhammer*.
<<battle pass>> :: A type of in-game monetization that provides additional content for a game through a tiered system, rewarding the player with in-game items by playing the game and completing specific challenges.

<<best-in-slot>> Any item or ability that can be considered the best possible option in a given slot. This can vary between players and playstyles, but commonly, any specific playstyle is likely to have either a single or a small set of items considered to be the best. This may be due to favorable effects, good match-ups against most opponents, or high stats. Typically abbreviated as BiS.
<<beta release>>  :: Also *beta testing*.
<<blacklist>> In online games, a list of player information (such as player ID or IP address) that the server checks for when admitting a player. By default, players are allowed to enter, but if they match information on the blacklist, they are barred from entry. The opposite is a whitelist, where the server bars players by default but allows players matching the whitelist. Blacklists and whitelists can be used in tandem, barring even whitelisted players if they try to log in via a blacklisted IP address, for example.
<<BM >> "Bad Manners"; conduct that is not considered 'cheating' but may be seen as unsportsmanlike or disrespectful. ^{[25]} Some games may elect to punish badly behaved players by assessing game penalties, temporarily blocking them from re-entering play, or banishing them to a playing environment populated solely by other badly behaved players. What constitutes bad manners is subjective and may be hard to gather a consensus on.
<<board>> See level.
<<booster pack>> :: A random assortment of cards in digital collectible card games that players can buy or earn to add to their deck. See also lootbox.
<<boosting>> In online multiplayer games that include ranked competitive play, boosting is where a player with a low-ranked level has a more-skilled player use their account to improve the low-ranked character to higher levels, or other improvements and benefits for their account. ^{[26]} ^{[27]}
<<bonus stage>>  :: A special level in which the player has a chance to earn extra points or power-ups, often in the form of a mini-game. Compare with secret level.
<<borderless fullscreen windowed >> An option featured in many modern PC games and moddable into others in which a game appears fullscreen but is actually running in a maximized window. Since the game does not take full control of the output device, it confers benefits such as seamless task switching and automatic vertical synchronization.
<<boss>>  :: An opponent non-player character in a video game that is typically much more difficult to defeat compared to normal enemies, often at the end of a level or a game.
<<bot>> Short for robot. A non-playable character which is controlled by an artificial intelligence (AI). The player may compete against or work with a bot to complete objectives. Is also a derogatory term that implies a player is less effective than a computerized character.
<<bottomless pit>> A hazard common in platform and action games, which consists of a deep hole or void with no visible bottom, presumably leading to a fatal drop. The player-character falling into this void typically results in an instant death (and the loss of a life) for the player, regardless of how much health the character had; although some games may instead take away a percentage of the character's health before respawning them nearby. Bottomless pits can also serve as obstacles that can be overcome by using abilities or finding alternate routes.
<<buff>>  :: 1.  An effect placed on a video game character that beneficially increases one or more of their statistics or characteristics for a temporary period. Compare to debuff.
<<bullet hell>> :: A type of shoot 'em up where the player must generally dodge an overwhelmingly large number of enemies and their projectiles.
<<bullet sponge>> Any enemy that appears to require more firepower than would be considered realistic or reasonable to defeat. This is an allusion to how the enemy can absorb bullets much like a sponge absorbs liquids. For example, an enemy soldier in a first-person shooter that requires several full magazines of ammunition to defeat, in comparison to other soldier types that are defeated in a handful of shots, would be a bullet sponge.
<<bullshot>> A portmanteau of /bullshit/ and /screenshot/, referring to the misrepresentation of a final product's technical or artistic quality by artificially enhancing promotional images or video footage. ^{[28]}
<<button mashing>> 1.  The pressing of different button combinations in rapid succession to perform or attempt to perform special moves, typically with little rhyme or reason. This technique is most often encountered in fighting games, especially among weaker players. ^{[29]}
<<breach>> common name for the value that dictates how much stun a weapon deals.
<<campaign mode>> Also *story mode* and *campaign*.
<<camping>>  :: 1.  Where a player stays in one place -- typically a fortified high-traffic location -- for an extended period of time and waits to ambush other players. Many players consider camping a form of cheating. ^{[30]} It is most common in first-person shooter games, ^{[31]} but is also frequent in fighting games with projectile-heavy characters.
<<capture the flag>> (CTF) :: A common game mode in multiplayer video games, where the goal is to capture and retrieve a flag from the opposing side's territory while defending the flag in one's own territory.
<<carry>> :: In team-based video games, when a player disproportionately contributes to the success of their team. For example, Team A's sole remaining player defeating the rest of Team B, thus saving Team A from a close defeat, would be considered carrying, as would one player on Team A having the most kills among the rest of their team. The term is usually but not always interpreted as indirect slander towards the rest of the team, though the term may also be used generally. Carrying may also be a method experienced players use to win rounds when the rest of their team are less experienced or less efficient at completing tasks; this may entail taking on enemy combatants alone, or using teammates as a distraction while completing objectives for the round.
<<cartridge tilting>> Deliberately inducing glitches and other strange behaviour in cartridge-based games by tilting the cartridge slightly in its slot in the console, enough for the connection to be altered but not completely severed. Cartridge tilting creates similar effects to using a corruptor, and may include such glitches as character models becoming distorted, extremely loud noises and in particularly severe cases, both the game and the console itself may crash.
<<casual gaming>>  :: Playing video games on an infrequent and spontaneous basis without a long-term commitment. Casual video games are distinguished by a low learning curve and ease of access, often web-based for mobile phones or personal computers. Most casual games have simplified controls, with one or two buttons dominating play. Casual games can normally be played in small periods of time, and may not have a save feature. ^{[32]}
<<challenge mode>> A game mode offered beyond the game's normal play mode that tasks the player(s) to replay parts of the game or special levels under specific conditions that are not normally present or required in the main game, such as finishing a level within a specific time, or using only one type of weapon. If a game doesn't feature a 'challenge mode', players will often create self-imposed challenges by forbidding or restricting the use of certain game mechanics.
<<character class>>  :: A job or profession that comes with a set of abilities as well as positive and negative attributes. ^{[33]} Most common in role-playing games, a character's class helps to define their playstyle as well as the role the character plays in a team based game. Often as players gain experience with a class they learn new abilities related to their chosen profession and some games allow players to change their character's class or become proficient in multiple classes. Some examples of archetypal character classes include warrior (strength and defense), thief (speed and stealth), wizard (magic and intelligence), and priest or healer (healing and buffing allies). ^{[34]} ^{[35]} A popular example of a class-changing system is the Job System in the /Final Fantasy/ series.
<<character creator>> :: An ingame method to customize a character to the player's preferred appearance and abilities before starting the game, most commonly used in role-playing games.
<<character select screen>> A concept in games with multiple characters, a screen with names and/or pictures of all playable (and secret) characters with the possibility of stat listings.
<<charge shot>> A shot that can be charged up so that a stronger attack can be dealt, but requiring more time. Usually performed by holding the shot button.
<<cheat>>  :: A game code that allows the player to beat the game or acquire benefits without earning them. Cheats are used by designers to test the game during development and are often left in the release version. ^{[16]} See god mode, aimbot, ESP cheats, noclip mode, wallhack, and Konami Code.
<<cheating>>  :: To play the game unfairly; giving an unfair advantage via illegitimate means.
<<checkpoint >> An area in a level from which the player will start the level from next time they die, rather than having to start the level over. Checkpoints typically remain in place until the player completes the level or gets a Game Over.
<<cheese (or cheesing)>> Cheese(ing) refers to a tactic in a video game that may be considered cheap, unfair, or overly easy, requiring no skill by others as to otherwise complete a difficult task. What may account as cheese depends on the type of game. Its origin traces back to players of /Street Fighter II/ who would frequently use the same combo move over and over against to defeat their opponent. In multiplayer games like MOBAs or hero shooters, certain team compositions of heroes are considered cheese compositions for how easily they can defeat most other team compositions. In other games, cheese can refer to exploiting glitches and other bugs to make difficult gameplay sections easy. ^{[36]}
<<cheevo>> See achievement.
<<chiptune>> :: Music composed for the microchip-based audio hardware of early home computers and gaming consoles. Due to the technical limitations of earlier video game hardware, chiptune came to define a style of its own, known for its "soaring flutelike melodies, buzzing square wave bass, rapid arpeggios, and noisy gated percussion". ^{[37]}
<<choke>> 1.  When a player/team that is currently winning or expected to win a match performs unexpectedly poorly. ^{[25]}
<<cinematic>> See cutscene.
<<circle strafing>> :: An advanced method of movement in many first-person shooter (FPS) games where the user utilizes both thumb sticks (console) or mouse and keyboard controls (PC) to maintain a constant circular motion around an enemy, while maintaining a relatively steady aim on that target. This practice minimizes incoming fire from the target's teammates, as any misses are likely to hit and harm their teammate.
<<clapped>> When you clap a player, you deal enough damage to eliminate them, without them hitting you or shooting you once.
<<class>> See character class.
<<class identity>> The perception of a character class's distinctness from others. For example, the class identity of a "paladin" would include defensive and melee capabilities as compared to a ranged class like an "archer".

<<clipping>> 1.  Programming used to ensure that the player stays within the physical boundaries of the game world. ^{[14]} ^{: 119 } Also see noclip, a cheat where clipping is disabled.
<<clock/clocked>> To achieve a score so high it resets the in-game score counter back to 0, often used in older arcade games. More commonly used nowadays to express the (absolute) 100% completion of a game. Also see rolling the score.
<<clone>> :: A game that is similar in design to another game in its genre (e.g., a /Doom/ clone or a /Grand Theft Auto/ clone). Sometimes used in a derogatory fashion to refer to an inferior 'ripoff' of a more successful title.
<<closed beta>> :: A beta testing period where only specific people have access to the game.
<<cloud gaming>>  :: A cloud gaming server runs the game, receiving controller input actions from and streaming audio and video to the player's thin client.
<<cloud save>> The player's saved game is stored at a remote server. This may provide a backup, or enable access from a different game system. See also cross-save.

<<CMS>> See also construction and management simulation.
<<coin-op>> See also arcade game.
<<collision detection>>  :: The computational task of detecting the intersection of two or more game objects.
<<combo>> :: A series of attacks strung together in quick succession, typically while an opponent is in their "getting hit" animation from the previous attack and is helpless to defend themselves. Combos are a staple of fighting games, introduced in beat-'em-ups such as /Renegade/ and /Double Dragon/, and becoming more dynamic in /Final Fight/ and /Street Fighter II/. ^{[39]}
<<competitive gaming>> See electronic sports.
<<completionist>> A particular kind of video game player who focuses on achieving 100% completion in the games they play.
<<compulsion loop>> :: A cycle of gameplay elements designed to keep the player invested in the game, typically though a feedback system involving in-game rewards that open up more gameplay opportunities.
<<console>> :: A video game hardware unit that typically connects to a video screen and controllers, along with other hardware.

Sometimes includes handheld consoles, to differentiate them from computers, arcade machines, and cell phones.
<<console generations >> See also: Home video game console generations
<<console wars >> Main article: Console war
<<construction and management simulation>> (CMS) :: A video game genre that involves planning and managing a population of citizens in towns, cities, or other population centers. In such games, the player rarely has direct control of the computer-controlled citizens and can only influence them through planning.
<<content rating>>  :: Classifying video games according to suitability-related factors such as violent or sexual content contained within a game. Some countries use industry self-regulation models to accomplish this, while others have government rating boards. Certain content ratings result in products being legally or /de facto/ banned from sale, such as the AO (adults only) rating in the United States. While legal, such titles are not stocked by retailers and will not be certified for release by major console makers such as Sony and Microsoft.
<<continue >> #+CAPTION: /A7Xpg/ gives the player the opportunity to continue playing after losing their last life.

For example, a conversion kit can be used to reconfigure an arcade machine designed to play one game so that it would play its sequel or update instead, such as from /Star Wars/ to /The Empire Strikes Back/, or from /Street Fighter II: Champion Edition/ to /Street Fighter II Turbo/.
<<cooldown>> The minimum length of time that the player needs to wait after using an ability before they can use it again. This is commonly done for game balance so less powerful abilities remain relevant. ^{[46]}
<<co-op>> See cooperative gameplay.
<<cooperative gameplay>> (co-op)  :: Multiplayer gameplay where the players work together on the same team against computer-controlled opponents or challenges. ^{[16]}
<<corruptor>> A computer program used either as or in conjunction with an emulator to corrupt certain data within a ROM or ISO by a user-desired amount, causing varied effects, both visually and audibly, to a video game and its data, usually as a humorous diversion or for the sake of seeking out and documenting interesting examples, hereafter referred to as corruptions. The effects of a corruption may include: displaced or misdirected pixels in a spritemap; never-ending levels; bizarre or unexpected changes to the colour palette of characters and levels; artifacts; distorted or entirely incorrect sprites, polygons, textures, or character models; spastic and outlandish animations; incorrect text or dialogue trees; flickering graphics or lights; incorrect or distorted audio; inconvenient invisible walls; lack of collision detection; and other forced glitches.

<<coyote time>> A game mechanic that grants players the ability to jump for a brief period of time (typically just a few frames or fractions of a second) after leaving solid ground. Used predominantly in platform games, the mechanic is designed to give players the impression of having jumped at the last possible moment, and as a method of forgiving players that would have otherwise missed the jump. The mechanic derives its name from the /Looney Tunes/ character Wile E. Coyote who, upon leaving solid ground (e.g. by running off a cliff), briefly hangs in mid-air before plummeting to the earth below. ^{[48]} ^{[49]}
<<CPU >> 1.   Central processing unit; the part of the computer or video game which executes the games' program.

<<cranking 90s>>  :: Commonly used in Fortnite, cranking 90s refers of a way to build in the game. "90s" refers to the 90-degree turn one must make when they make a 90, ^{[50]} and "cranking" refers to how one must perform this repeatedly. "Cranking" 90s usually results in a tower being created.
<<credit-feeding>> To complete an arcade game by using as many continues as possible. Prevalent in action games or shooters where the player is revived at the exact moment their character died during their previous credit. Some home conversions (such as AES versions of Neo Geo games) tend to limit the number of credits each player is allowed to use in a playthrough as a way of preserving the challenge, while other conversions (such as the ports in the /Namco Museum/ series) impose no such limits in order to reproduce the original version as faithfully as possible. Compare with 1CC.
<<critical hit>>  :: Also *crit*.
<<cross-buy>> Ownership of a game on multiple platforms granted through a single purchase.
<<cross-platform>> See multiplatform.
<<cross-platform play>> :: Multi-platform versions of the same online games may be played together.

<<Debug mode>> A feature left in a game that the development team would use to test the game and check for bugs. There are many ways that they could have been implemented, such as a menu with selectable options, button combinations or a room with stuff useful for testing. Debug modes will tend to have many useful features for testing, such as being able to make the player invulnerable to damage, giving the tester every single weapon available, being able to warp to any part of the game as needed, being able to defeat any enemy in a single hit, and so on. There may also be the ability to modify the camera placement, such as for the purpose of taking screenshots to use for advertising purposes.

<<note highway>> :: A visual element of most rhythm games that show the notes the player must match as they scroll along the screen. This is more commonly considered a "highway" when the notes scroll down the screen on a perspective-based grid, making it appear as a road highway. ^{[ /citation needed/]}
<<nt >> Meaning "Nice try". Generally said through a chat function in online multiplayer games to boost the morale of players. Can be directed towards both the friendly and enemy teams. Used when teammates or opponents fail after trying something new, or put in large amounts of effort towards the objective to no avail. ^{[108]} "Nice try" could also be used in a condescending manner to mock opponents.
<<nuke>> A spell or skill that is capable of dealing a large amount of damage to its target. Also in the context of video games, *"nuking"* may also describe the act of using a nuclear weapon while playing the game, such as the atomic bomb in /Call of Duty/ games. In an MMORPG, nuking may differ in meaning between different communities. ^{[109]} For example, to some individuals, to "nuke" is to deal the most possible damage to the most enemies possible (almost exclusively by means of an area of effect skill), whereas other individuals use the term by referring to the highest possible damage to a single target in the shortest amount of time, also known as a spike. Some individuals believe that the player, or players, nuking must do so by means of ranged combat (that is, out of melee range); others make no such distinction. It can also mean to critical hit often or just to deal high standard damage. In a real-time or turn-based strategy game, the term "nuke" has one distinct use. It can describe the tactic of attacking an opponent's specific (often high-priority) units with high-damage spells in order to kill them or force (or strongly encourage) the opposing player to remove them from battle. Such usage is common in /Warcraft III/, in which "Heroes" are frequently the targets and attackers due to their relative high priority and common faculty for high-damaging spells.

Not used for free-to-play or freemium games.
<<on rails >> A term that refers to gameplay in which the player can only progress in one direction with limited exploration or branching, similar to a dark ride at theme parks.

<<paddle>> :: A game controller that primarily included a large dial that could be turned either clockwise or counter-clockwise to generate movement in one dimension within a game.
<<palette swap>> Video game characters which are graphically similar except for a hue-shifted palette. Typically done to preserve resources or data space that would otherwise be used up by different designs for the same character, especially for games with sprite-based graphics, though other reasons may exist for palette swaps, such as differentiating similar-looking characters with different properties (e.g. the Green and Red Koopa Troopas from the /Super Mario/ series having different behaviors), or accommodating for the presence of more than one instance of the same unique character to avoid confusion or paradoxes (e.g. /Super Smash Bros./ characters having multiple palette swaps to avoid confusion in matches where multiple players pick the same character).
<<party>> 1.  In a cooperative multiplayer game, a team of players working together to complete the same mission or quest. See Role-playing game § Game mechanics.

<<pause>> The option to temporarily suspend play of a video game, allowing the player to take a break or attend to an urgent matter outside of the game, or to perform other actions, such as adjusting options, saving the current game and/or ending the current game session. In multiplayer online or networked games, pausing may not be available as a feature, as such games require continuous activity from all participating players in order to properly function.
<<paywall>> :: A monetization method that requires players to spend money to access gameplay features.
<<pay to win>> Also *P2W* or *PTW*.
<<peak>> Commonly used when you or someone in the current lobby you are in does something that is above their current skill level.

<<peripheral>> An optional hardware component for a video game system. ^{[113]}
<<perks>> :: Special bonuses that video game players can add to their characters to give special abilities. Similar to power ups, but permanent.

<<ping system >> In co-operative multiplayer games, gameplay feature that allows players on the same team to visibly highlight, or "ping", other features on the map (such as waypoints, enemies, or treasure) to their allied players. While ping systems existed in various genres such as MOBAs before, /Apex Legends/ in the late 2010s was cited with popularizing the system for first-person shooters that enabled effective communication between players without the need for voice chat. ^{[118]}
<<pity pull>>  :: A mechanic in certain gacha games where a player will eventually be guaranteed a high-quality item after too many unsuccessful pulls.
<<pixel hunting >> A game element that involves searching an entire scene for a single (often pixel-sized) point of interactivity. Common in adventure games, most players consider 'hunt-the-pixel' puzzles to be a tedious chore, borne of inadequate game design. ^{[119]} The text-adventure version of this problem is called 'guess-the-verb' or 'syntax puzzle'.
<<pixel-perfect>> An action that must be performed whilst being positioned within a pixel-wide gap for perfect execution. A pixel in this case may refer to a screen pixel or an in-game pixel, such as in video games that utilize pixel art.
<<Plant>> "Plants" are often found in games that feature a variety of microtransactions. They are "players" who collude with game developers to promote unhealthy competition. These "plants" are discretely given free and powerful items by game developers. This is typically done to artificially create competition for the legitimate paying players so that the already paying players feel the need to spend more money to compete against this new "player."
<<platform>> :: 1.  A buzzword for operating system, a video game is released for Windows or Android and so forth, not for PC, console or mobile. A corporation that controls a platform is referred to as a "platform holder".

<<player-character>> (PC) :: The character controlled and played by the human player in a video game. Often the game's main protagonist. Tidus from /Final Fantasy X/ and Doomguy from the /Doom/ series are all "player-characters" developed by their game studios. Compare with NPC.
<<player versus environment>> (PvE) :: Refers to fighting computer-controlled enemies ( non-player characters), as opposed to player versus player (PvP).
<<player versus player>> (PvP) :: Refers to competing against other players, as opposed to player versus environment (PvE).

<<pocket (pocketing)>> Pocketing refers in multiplayer games to when a player (usually playing the part of a healer support) supports exclusively a single teammate (usually a tank), either at an extended period of time but with several teammates or during the entire match with a single teammate. This is done with the intent of assuring the supported player's survival during the time they're being supported. The term pocket refers either to the supporting player, or the supported player.
<<pog/poggers >> From PogChamp, a term meaning great or awesome, often a play in a game.
<<point of no return >> A point in a game from which the player cannot return to previous areas.
<<port>> See game port.

<<popping off >> Used mostly in the context of esports competitions or video game streaming, a gamer is said to "pop off" when they unexpectedly perform exceptionally well in a video game for a short period of time.
<<power-up>> :: An object that temporarily gives extra abilities or buffs to the game character. Persistent power-ups are called perks.
<<power creep >> The gradual unbalancing of a game due to successive releases of new content. ^{[120]} The phenomenon may be caused by a number of different factors and, in extreme cases, can be damaging to the longevity of the game in which it takes place. Game expansions are usually stronger than previously existing content, giving consumers an incentive to buy it for competitions against other players or as new challenges for the single-player experience. While the average power level within the game rises, older content falls out of balance and becomes regressively outdated or relatively underpowered, effectively rendering it useless from a competitive or challenge-seeking viewpoint. Very occasionally may refer to the result of repeatedly balancing a game primarily through buffs and nerfs, thus making every character substantially more powerful than they were at release. See also: planned obsolescence.
<<power spike>> The moment in which a character sees a rise in relative strength from leveling up larger than that of a normal milestone. This is usually due to an item becoming available or certain abilities being unlocked.
<<p-rank>> Often awarded in games for completing a level or challenge 'perfectly,' such as in the fastest time possible or by defeating an enemy without taking damage.
<<pro>> Shortened version of the word "professional". Someone with experience, skill, and especially know-how in a certain game.
<<proc>> The activation, trigger or occurrence of a conditional, often random, event. Particularly common for massively multiplayer online games, they are conditional events where special equipment provide the user with temporary extra powers, or when the opposing enemy suddenly becomes more powerful in some way. The term's origin is uncertain, possibly from /programmed random occurrence/, /process/, or /procedure/. ^{[121]}
<<procedural generation>> :: When the game algorithmically combines randomly generated elements, particularly in game world creation. See also Roguelike.
<<pro gamer move>> A strategic and tactical move that shows that the player is familiar with or skilled in a game and its gameplay mechanics. Sometimes used outside of video games, and occasionally used in an ironic manner to describe a poorly-planned move or failure. ^{[122]}
<<professional gaming>> See electronic sports.
<<progression system>> The game mechanics that determine how a player improves their player-character over the course of a game or several games, such as gaining experience points to level up characters, performing tasks to gain new abilities, or part of a metagame improvement.

Used as a taunt that means "cry more". ^{[123]} Originally referred to the shortcut Alt+Q+Q from /Warcraft 2/, used as an insult telling players to activate the shortcut which would quit the game. ^{[124]} The phrase blew up so much, it made its way out of the /Warcraft/ community and eventually evolved into "cry more".
<<QTE>> See quick time event.
<<quality assurance>> Quality Assurance teams for games will play through a title multiple times in an attempt to find and track down bugs, glitches and crashes in the game before it goes live. This process can start early in development and can last until after post-production. Not to be mistaken with playtesting.
<<quality of life (QoL)>> Features or improvements designed to make games easier and smoother to play without changing the gameplay itself. ^{[125]} ^{[126]} ^{[127]}
<<quest>>  :: Any objective-based activity created in-game for the purpose of either story (story quest) or character-level advancement (side quest). Quests follow many common types, such as defeating a number of specific monsters, gathering a number of specific items, or safely escorting a non-player character. Some quests involve more-detailed information and mechanics and are either greatly enjoyed by players as a break from the common monotony or are reviled as uselessly more-complicated than necessary.
<<quick time event>> (QTE) :: An event within a game that typically requires the player to press an indicated controller button or move a controller's analog controls within a short time window to succeed in the event and progress forward, while failure to do so may harm the player-character or lead to a game-over situation. Such controls are generally non-standard for the game, and the action performed in a quick time event is usually not possible to execute in regular gameplay. ^{[128]}
<<quicksave >> 1.  A mechanism in a video game where progress to or from a saved game can be done by pressing a single controller button or keystroke, instead of opening a file dialog to locate the save file. Typically, there is only one quickload location and quicksaving will overwrite any previously saved state.

<<rack>> See level.
<<radar >> A smaller version of the play area, typically displayed in the corner of a players screen used for navigating the game world. May also display locations of friendly and/or enemy players. See also Minimap.
<<ragdoll>> :: Also *ragdolling*.
<<rage>> A genre designed to cause anger and frustration in the player, using unintuitive controls, unforeseeable obstacles, unfair challenges and/or taunting the player, often with the express stated purpose of causing the player to rage quit. Completing a rage game is commonly seen as a measure of determination and resolve as much as skill.
<<rage quit >> Also *gamer rage*. ^{[129]}
<<raid>> :: A type of mission in a game where a number of people attempt to defeat either: (a) another number of people at player-vs-player (PVP), (b) a series of computer-controlled enemies (non-player characters; NPCs) in a player-vs-environment (PVE) battlefield, or (c) a very powerful boss (superboss).

<<real-time corruptor>> A type of ROM/ISO corruptor program which incrementally and gradually corrupts video game data in real time as the game is being played for the purpose of finding amusing or interesting results. The rate at which the data is corrupted, and its severity can be changed by the user at will, enabling the game to be played in a corrupted state or to suddenly increase the intensity of the resultant glitches.
<<real-time strategy>> (RTS) :: A genre of video game where the player controls one or more units in real-time combat with human or computer opponents.
<<reboot>> A "restart" of a video game series, usually applying big changes to characters, settings, gameplay, or the overall story, while still keeping identifiable elements of the original games. ^{[132]} See also remaster and remake.
<<remake>>  :: A revamped version of an older game. Sharing many similarities to a remaster, a remake may take more liberties with the changes made to the gameplay, graphics, and story. ^{[133]} ^{[132]} See also remaster and reboot, contrast with demake.
<<remaster>>  :: A modern version of an older video game rebuilt from scratch to run on modern hardware, often with upgraded graphics and gameplay, but retaining the fundamental gameplay concepts and core story elements of the original game. ^{[133]} ^{[132]} See also reboot and remaster.
<<remorting>> :: Also *rerolling*
<<remote play>> Playing a game on an owned device remotely over the internet.
<<replay value>>  :: The ability to play a game again after its completion with reasonable enjoyment.
<<respawn>> The reappearance of an entity, such as a character or object, after its death or destruction.
<<respecing >> In games where a player-character gains skills along a skill tree by spending points, the act of respecing ("re-specialization") allows the player to remove all skills and then respend those points on a different set of skills. This usually requires an expenditure of in-game money or other earned gameplay element.
<<retrogaming>>  :: Also *old-school gaming*
<<review bomb>> :: Actions taken by players to leave negative reviews of a game or other form of media on a digital storefront or user-contributed as a form of protest due to actions typically unrelated to the game or media quality itself.

<<rocket jumping>> :: Also *grenade jumping*.
<<roguelike>>  :: A sub-genre of games primarily featuring procedurally-generated levels, tile-based movement, turn-based action, complex maps to explore, resource management, and permanent death. Games that lack some of those elements are usually better termed dungeon crawlers, but can be referred to as "Roguelites"; in particular, permadeath alone does not make a game Roguelike. Roguelikes are typically set in dungeons, but may contain an overworld or other settings. Roguelike games are usually designed to be more challenging than typical games, with luck and memory playing a larger role. Named after the 1980 game /Rogue/.
<<roguelite>>  :: Games that have some, but not all, features of Roguelike games. Typically they involve a different style of gameplay from the tile-based movement, but retain procedurally-generated levels, resource maps, and permanent death. While games may self-identify as Roguelites, it can also be used as a derogatory term. Often used instead of "Roguelike" by mistake, but the two are different.
<<role-playing>> (RP) :: A broad set of behaviours within video games where players change their behaviour to assume a role. Not exclusive to role-playing video games. Roleplaying may be as simple as a player acting to fit a medieval setting; as detailed as a player detailing their character's backstory, personal life, and mannerisms; or as complex as a MilSim game's clans having scheduled trainings, realistically long mission times, and military-like ranks and organization.
<<role-playing video game>> (RPG) :: A game in which the human player takes on the role of a specific character "class" and advances the skills and abilities of that character within the game environment. RPG characters generally have a wide variety of skills and abilities available to them, and much theorycrafting is involved in creating the best possible form of each of these character classes. This is different from games such as first-person shooters (FPS), where the player-character in those games are all standardized forms and the physical skills of the player involved are the determining factor in their success or failure within the game. In an RPG, a human player can be the best player in the world at the game, but if they are using a character build that is substandard, they can be significantly outplayed by a lesser player running a more-optimal character build.
<<rolling the score>> The act of achieving such a high score that the game's ability to display the score restarts, displays a negative number, or is otherwise unable to accurately display the score. Originates from early games that had limitations on the number that could be displayed as a score, such as pinball with a limited number of analog or digital number places, or video game systems with limited numbers of bytes. If a player's score exceeded that limit, it would cause an integer overflow, causing the display to 'roll over' and start again at the minimum possible score, or sometimes a negative number in 8-bit video games.
<<ROM hacking>> :: The process of modifying a ROM image of a video game to alter the game's graphics, dialogue, levels, gameplay, or other elements. This is usually done by technically inclined video-game fans to breathe new life into a cherished old game, as a creative outlet, or to make essentially new unofficial games using the old game's engine.
<<room>> 1.  A small, open area in a map, typically self-contained, surrounded by walls and connected to adjacent rooms by doors. In many cases, specific types of entities such as enemies cannot travel between rooms, while the player can. Rooms are often used to reduce lag by only loading the entities in the player's current room, ‘pausing' all other rooms.
<<room-over-room >> The placement of a room directly above another room. This was impossible to achieve with the /Doom/ engine which did mapping in 2D, with height variance done via numbers. In true 3D game engines to follow, such as those using the /Quake/ engine, room-over-room became an easy effect to accomplish.
<<round>> See level.
<<RPG >> 1.  Abbreviation of role-playing game.
<<RTS>> See real-time strategy.
<<rubber banding>> 1.  A game mechanic resulting from dynamic game difficulty balancing that alters the rules of the game to keep the game competitive and fun. Most notable in racing games, where human players may easily outdistance computer opponents; when this happens, the computer opponents are often given the ability to go faster than normal or to avoid certain obstacles as to allow them to catch up and outpace the player. The effect is likened to stretching and releasing a rubber band between the player and the computer opponent. This effect may also apply to human players as well, with the game providing (often unstated) handicaps for losing players to stay competitive. ^{[ /citation needed/]}
<<rush>> A tactic in strategy games where the player sacrifices economic development in favor of using many low-cost fast/weak units to rush and overwhelm an enemy by attrition or sheer numbers. ^{[ /citation needed/]} Can also be used to refer to a quick "rush" onto an objective or point, with the intention to overwhelm by surprise or speed.
<<S Rank>> An achievement awarded to a player in a single level, song, round, or stage by finishing them without "Miss" or any mistakes, or taking damage, or for getting the highest scores or percentage cleared (usually above 90% or 98%). The term can mean a high rating level or a rarity of an item or character within the confines of the game (as valuated by the developer), but it is also used by players in tier lists to refer to the top of the video game meta.
<<sandbox game>>  :: A game with a gameplay element that gives the player a great degree of creativity to complete tasks towards a goal within the game, if such a goal exists. Some games exist as pure sandbox games with no objectives; these are also known as non-games or software toys. Very common examples of sandbox games are ones where the player has the ability to create, modify, or destroy their environment, i.e., a game that includes some form of a game creation system. The term alludes to a child's sandbox where the child can create and destroy with no given objective. While ' open world' and 'sandbox' are sometimes used interchangeably (or with only the implication of 'sandbox' being smaller), the terms refer to different concepts and are not synonymous.
<<save point >> A place in the game world of a video game where the player's progress in the game can be saved. Often, when the player dies or receives a Game Over, their progress will be reset back to the last Save Point that they used. Some games do not have specific save points, allowing the player to save at any point.
<<save scumming>> :: The manipulation of game save states to gain an advantage during play or achieve a particular outcome from unpredictable events. ^{[139]} It is used, for example, in Roguelike games that automatically delete any save files when the player-character dies.
<<saved game>>  :: Also *game save*, *savegame*, or *savefile*.
<<screen cheat>> The act of looking at other players' areas of the screen when playing split-screen multiplayer, giving the screen cheater an unfair advantage. The 2014 game /Screencheat/ derives both its name and core gameplay from this act.
<<score attack>> :: A mode of gameplay that challenges the player to earn the highest score possible in a game level or through the whole game.
<<scuffed>> Poor quality.
<<season>> 1.  The full set of downloadable content that is planned to be added to a video game, which can be entirely purchased with a season pass
