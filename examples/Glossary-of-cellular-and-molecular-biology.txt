<<3' untranslated region>> (3'-UTR) ::
<<3'-end>> :: One of two ends of a single linear strand of DNA or RNA, specifically the end at which the chain of nucleotides terminates at the third carbon atom in the furanose ring of deoxyribose or ribose (i.e. the terminus at which the 3' carbon is not attached to another nucleotide via a phosphodiester bond; /in vivo/, the 3' carbon is often still bonded to a hydroxyl group). By convention, sequences and structures positioned nearer to the 3'-end relative to others are referred to as downstream. Contrast /5'-end/.
<<5' cap>> :: A specially altered nucleotide attached to the 5'-end of some primary RNA transcripts as part of the set of post-transcriptional modifications which convert raw transcripts into mature RNA products. The precise structure of the 5' cap varies widely by organism; in eukaryotes, the most basic cap consists of a methylated guanine nucleoside bonded to the triphosphate group that terminates the 5'-end of an RNA sequence. Among other functions, capping helps to regulate the export of mature RNAs from the nucleus, prevent their degradation by exonucleases, and promote translation in the cytoplasm. Mature mRNAs can also be decapped.
<<5' untranslated region>> (5'-UTR) ::
<<5-bromodeoxyuridine>> See /bromodeoxyuridine/.
<<5'-end>> :: One of two ends of a single linear strand of DNA or RNA, specifically the end at which the chain of nucleotides terminates at the fifth carbon atom in the furanose ring of deoxyribose or ribose (i.e. the terminus at which the 5' carbon is not attached to another nucleotide via a phosphodiester bond; /in vivo/, the 5' carbon is often still bonded to a phosphate group). By convention, sequences and structures positioned nearer to the 5'-end relative to others are referred to as upstream. Contrast /3'-end/.
<<5-methyluracil>> See /thymine/.
<<acentric>> :: (of a linear chromosome or chromosome fragment) Having no centromere. ^{[2]}
<<acetyl coenzyme A>> (acetyl-CoA) :: A biochemical compound consisting of a coenzyme A molecule to which an acetyl group ( --COCH ^{}\\
<<acetylation>> :: The covalent attachment of an acetyl group ( --COCH ^{}\\
<<acetyltransferase>> :: Any of a class of transferase enzymes which catalyze the covalent bonding of an acetyl group ( --COCH ^{}\\
<<acrocentric>> :: (of a linear chromosome or chromosome fragment) Having a centromere positioned very close to one end of the chromosome, as opposed to at the end or in the middle. ^{[2]}
<<action potential>> :: The local change in voltage that occurs when the membrane potential of a specific location along the membrane of a cell rapidly depolarizes, such as when a nerve impulse is transmitted between neurons.
<<activation>> See /upregulation/.
<<activator>> :: A type of transcription factor that increases the transcription of a gene or set of genes. Most activators work by binding to a specific sequence located within or near an enhancer or promoter and facilitating the binding of RNA polymerase and other transcription machinery in the same region. See also /coactivator/; contrast /repressor/.
<<active site>> :: The region of an enzyme to which one or more substrate molecules bind, causing the substrate or another molecule to undergo a chemical reaction. This region usually consists of one or more amino acid residues (commonly three or four) which, when the enzyme is folded properly, are able to form temporary chemical bonds with the atoms of the substrate molecule; it may also include one or more additional residues which, by interacting with the substrate, are able to catalyze a specific reaction involving the substrate. Though the active site constitutes only a small fraction of all the residues comprising the enzyme, its specificity for particular substrates and reactions is responsible for the enzyme's biological function.
<<active transport>> :: Transport of a substance (such as a protein or drug) across a membrane against a concentration gradient. Unlike passive transport, active transport requires an expenditure of energy.
<<adenine>> ( A) :: A purine nucleobase used as one of the four standard nucleobases in both DNA and RNA molecules. Adenine forms a base pair with thymine in DNA and with uracil in RNA.
<<adenosine>> ( A) :: One of the four standard nucleosides used in RNA molecules, consisting of an adenine base with its N _{9} nitrogen bonded to the C _{1} carbon of a ribose sugar. Adenine bonded to deoxyribose is known as deoxyadenosine, which is the version used in DNA.
<<adenosine diphosphate>> (ADP) ::
<<adenosine monophosphate>> (AMP) ::
<<adenosine triphosphate>> (ATP) :: An organic compound derived from adenine that functions as the major source of energy for chemical reactions inside living cells. It is found in all forms of life and is often referred to as the "molecular currency" of intracellular energy transfer.
<<A-DNA>> :: One of three main biologically active structural conformations of the DNA double helix, along with B-DNA and Z-DNA. The A-form helix has a right-handed twist with 11 base pairs per full turn, only slightly more compact than B-DNA, but its bases are sharply tilted with respect to the helical axis. It is often favored in dehydrated conditions and within sequences of consecutive purine nucleotides (e.g. GAAGGGGA); it is also the primary conformation adopted by double-stranded RNA and RNA-DNA hybrids. ^{[3]}
<<affected relative pair>> :: Any pair of organisms which are related genetically and both affected by the same trait. For example, two cousins who both have blue eyes are an affected relative pair since they are both affected by the allele that codes for blue eyes.
<<alkaline lysis>> ::
<<allele>> :: One of multiple alternative versions of an individual gene, each of which is a viable DNA sequence occupying a given position, or locus, on a chromosome. For example, in humans, one allele of the eye-color gene produces blue eyes and another allele of the same gene produces brown eyes.
<<allosome>> :: Any chromosome that differs from an ordinary autosome in size, form, or behavior and which is responsible for determining the sex of an organism. In humans, the X chromosome and the Y chromosome are sex chromosomes.
<<alpha helix>> (α-helix) :: A common structural motif in the secondary structures of proteins consisting of a right-handed helix conformation resulting from hydrogen bonding between amino acid residues which are not immediately adjacent to each other.
<<alternative splicing>> :: A regulated phenomenon of eukaryotic gene expression in which specific exons or parts of exons from the same primary transcript are variably included within or removed from the final, mature messenger RNA transcript. A class of post-transcriptional modification, alternative splicing allows a single gene to code for multiple protein isoforms and greatly increases the diversity of proteins that can be produced by an individual genome. See also /RNA splicing/.
<<amber>> :: One of three stop codons used in the standard genetic code; in RNA, it is specified by the nucleotide triplet UAG. The other two stop codons are named ochre and opal.
<<amino acid>> :: Any of a class of organic compounds whose basic structural formula includes a central carbon atom bonded to amine and carboxyl functional groups and to a variable side chain. Out of nearly 500 known amino acids, a set of 20 are coded for by the standard genetic code and incorporated into long polymeric chains as the building blocks of peptides and hence of polypeptides and proteins. The specific sequences of amino acids in the polypeptide chains that form a protein are ultimately responsible for determining the protein's structure and function.
<<amino terminus>> See /N-terminus/.
<<aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase>> :: Any of a set of enzymes which catalyze the transesterification reaction that results in the attachment of a specific amino acid (or a precursor) to one of its cognate transfer RNA molecules, forming an aminoacyl-tRNA. Each of the 20 different amino acids used in the genetic code is recognized and attached by its own specific synthetase enzyme, and most synthetases are cognate to several different tRNAs according to their specific anticodons.
<<aminoacyl-tRNA>> (aa-tRNA) :: A transfer RNA to which a cognate amino acid is chemically bonded; i.e. the product of a transesterification reaction catalyzed by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Aminoacyl-tRNAs bind to the aminoacyl site of the ribosome during translation.
<<amplicon>> :: Any DNA or RNA sequence or fragment that is the source and/or product of an amplification reaction. The term is most frequently used to describe the numerous copied fragments that are the products of the polymerase chain reaction or ligase chain reaction, though it may also refer to sequences that are amplified naturally within a genome, e.g. by gene duplication.
<<amplification>> The replication of a biomolecule, in particular the production of one or more copies of a nucleic acid sequence, known as an amplicon, either naturally (e.g. by spontaneous duplications) or artificially (e.g. by PCR), and especially implying many repeated replication events resulting in thousands, millions, or billions of copies of the target sequence, which is then said to be /amplified/.
<<anaphase>> :: The stage of mitosis and meiosis that occurs after metaphase and before telophase, when the replicated chromosomes are segregated and each of the sister chromatids are moved to opposite sides of the cell.
<<anaphase lag>> :: The failure of one or more pairs of sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes to properly migrate to opposite sides of the cell during anaphase of mitosis or meiosis due to a defective spindle apparatus. Consequently, both daughter cells are aneuploid: one is missing one or more chromosomes (creating a monosomy) while the other has one or more extra copies of the same chromosomes (creating a polysomy).
<<aneucentric>> (of a linear chromosome or chromosome fragment) Having an abnormal number of centromeres, i.e. more than one. ^{[4]}
<<aneuploidy>> :: The condition of a cell or organism having an abnormal number of one or more particular chromosomes (but excluding abnormal numbers of complete sets of chromosomes, which instead is known as euploidy).
<<annealing>> :: The hybridization of two single-stranded nucleic acid molecules containing complementary sequences, creating a double-stranded molecule with paired nucleobases. The term is used in particular to describe steps in laboratory techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, where double-stranded DNA molecules are repeatedly denatured into single strands by heating and then exposed to cooler temperatures, causing the strands to reassociate with each other or with complementary primers. The exact temperature at which annealing occurs is strongly influenced by the length and specific sequence of the individual strands.
<<antibody>> ::
<<anticodon>> :: A series of three consecutive nucleotides within a transfer RNA which complement the three nucleotides of a codon within an mRNA transcript. During translation, each tRNA recruited to the ribosome contains a single anticodon triplet that pairs with its complementary codon from the mRNA sequence, allowing each codon to specify a particular amino acid to be added to the growing peptide chain. Anticodons containing inosine in the first position are capable of pairing with more than one codon due to a phenomenon known as wobble base pairing.
<<antimetabolite>> :: Any molecule that functions as an antagonist to a metabolic process, limiting or inhibiting normal cellular metabolism; i.e. a metabolic poison. ^{[4]}
<<antimitotic>> :: Any compound that suppresses normal mitosis in a cell or population of cells. ^{[4]}
<<antioncogene>> :: A gene which helps to regulate cell growth and suppress tumors when functioning correctly, such that its absence or malfunction can result in uncontrolled cell growth and possibly cancer. ^{[5]} Compare /oncogene/.
<<antiparallel>> :: The orientation of two strands of a double-stranded nucleic acid (and more generally any pair of biopolymers) which are parallel to each other but with opposite directionality. For example, the two complementary strands of a DNA molecule run side-by-side but in opposite directions, with one strand oriented 5'-to- 3' and the other 3'-to-5'.
<<antiporter>> :: A transport protein which works by exchanging two different ions or small molecules across a membrane in opposite directions, either at the same time or consecutively. ^{[6]}
<<antisense>> See /template strand/.
<<antisense RNA>> (asRNA) :: A single-stranded non-coding RNA molecule containing an antisense sequence that is complementary to a sense strand, such as a messenger RNA, with which it readily hybridizes, thereby inhibiting the sense strand's further activity (e.g. translation into protein). Many different classes of naturally occurring RNA such as siRNA function by this principle, making them potent gene silencers in various gene regulation mechanisms. Synthetic antisense RNA has also found widespread use in gene knockdown studies, and in practical applications such as antisense therapy.
<<anucleate>> :: (of a cell or organism) Lacking a nucleus, i.e. a discrete, membrane-bound organelle enclosing the cell's genomic DNA, used especially of cells which normally have a nucleus but from which the nucleus has been removed (e.g. in artificial nuclear transfer), and also of specialized cell types that develop without nuclei despite that the cells of other tissues comprising the same organism ordinarily do have nuclei (e.g. mammalian erythrocytes).
<<apical constriction>> ::
<<apoptosis>> :: A highly regulated form of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms.
<<aptamer>> ::
<<artificial gene synthesis>> :: A set of laboratory methods used in the  /de novo/ synthesis of a gene (or any other nucleic acid sequence) from free nucleotides, i.e. without relying on an existing template strand.
<<assimilatory process>> Any process by which chemical compounds containing various essential elements (C, H, O, N, P, S, Se, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, or other oligo-elements) are uptaken by microorganisms and incorporated into complex biomolecules in order to synthesize various cellular components. In contrast, a dissimilatory process uses the energy released by decomposing exogenous molecules to power the cell's metabolism and then excretes residual or toxic compounds out of the cell, instead of reusing them to build new molecules.
<<asynapsis>> The failure of homologous chromosomes to properly pair with each other during meiosis. ^{[4]} Contrast /synapsis/ and /desynapsis/.
<<attached X>> A single monocentric chromosome containing two or more physically attached copies of the normal X chromosome as a result of either a natural internal duplication or any of a variety of genetic engineering methods. The resulting compound chromosome effectively carries two or more doses of all genes and sequences included on the X, yet functions in all other respects as a single chromosome, meaning that haploid 'XX' gametes (rather than the ordinary 'X' gametes) will be produced by meiosis and inherited by progeny. In mechanisms such as genic balance in which the sex of an organism is determined by the total dosage of X-linked genes, an abnormal 'XXY' zygote, fertilized by one XX gamete and one Y gamete, will develop into a female.
<<autolysis>> :: The lysis or digestion of a cell by its own enzymes; or of a particular enzyme by another instance of the same enzyme.
<<autosome>> :: Any chromosome that is not an allosome and hence is not involved in the determination of the sex of an organism. Unlike the sex chromosomes, the autosomes in a diploid cell exist in pairs, with the members of each pair having the same structure, morphology, and genetic loci.
<<autozygote>> :: A cell or organism that is homozygous for a locus at which the two homologous alleles are identical by descent, both having been derived from a single gene in a common ancestor. ^{[4]} Contrast /allozygote/.
<<auxesis>> :: The growth of a multicellular organism due to an increase in the size of its cells rather than an increase in the number of cells.
<<axenic>> :: Describing a cell culture in which only a single species, variety, or strain is present, and which is therefore entirely free of contaminating organisms including symbiotes and parasites.
<<B chromosome>> :: Any supernumerary nuclear DNA molecule which is not a duplicate of nor homologous to any of the standard complement of normal "A" chromosomes comprising a genome. Typically very small and devoid of structural genes, B chromosomes are by definition not necessary for life. Though they occur naturally in many eukaryotic species, they are not stably inherited and thus vary widely in copy number even between closely related individuals. ^{[4]}
<<back mutation>> A mutation that reverses the effect of a previous mutation which had inactivated a gene, thus restoring wild-type function. ^{[7]} See also /reverse mutation/.
<<backcrossing>> :: The breeding of a hybrid organism with one of its parents or an individual genetically similar to one of its parents, often intentionally as a type of selective breeding, with the aim of producing offspring with a genetic identity which is closer to that of the parent. The reproductive event and the resulting progeny are both referred to as a /backcross/, often abbreviated in genetics shorthand with the symbol /BC/.
<<bacterial artificial chromosome>> (BAC) ::
<<balancer chromosome>> ::
<<base>> An abbreviation of nitrogenous base and nucleobase.
<<base pair>> (bp) :: A pair of two nucleobases on complementary DNA or RNA strands which are bonded to each other by hydrogen bonds. The ability of consecutive base pairs to stack one upon another contributes to the long-chain double helix structures observed in both double-stranded DNA and double-stranded RNA molecules.
<<baseline>> A measure of the gene expression level of a gene or genes prior to a perturbation in an experiment, as in a negative control. /Baseline expression/ may also refer to the expected or historical measure of expression for a gene.
<<basic local alignment search tool>> (BLAST) :: A computer algorithm widely used in bioinformatics for aligning and comparing primary biological sequence information such as the nucleotide sequences of DNA or RNA or the amino acid sequences of proteins. BLAST programs enable scientists to quickly check for homology between two or more sequences by directly comparing the nucleotides or amino acids present at each position within each sequence; a common use is to search for matches between a specific query sequence and a digital sequence database such as a genome library, with the program returning a list of sequences from the database which resemble the query sequence above a specified threshold of similarity. Such comparisons can permit the identification of an organism from an unknown sample or the inference of evolutionary relationships between genes, proteins, or species.
<<B-DNA>> :: The "standard" or classical structural conformation of the DNA double helix /in vivo/, thought to represent an average of the various distinct conformations assumed by very long DNA molecules under physiological conditions. ^{[3]} The B-form double helix has a right-handed twist with a diameter of 23.7 ångströms and a pitch of 35.7 ångströms or about 10.5 base pairs per full turn, such that each nucleotide pair is rotated 36° around the helical axis with respect to its neighboring pairs. See also /A-DNA/ and /Z-DNA/.
<<beta oxidation>> ::
<<bidirectional replication>> A common mechanism of DNA replication in which two replication forks move in opposite directions away from the same origin; this results in a bubble-like region where the duplex molecule is locally separated into two single strands. ^{[4]}
<<binary fission>> ::
<<binding site>> ::
<<bioassay>> ::
<<biochemical pathway>> ::
<<bioenergetics>> ::
<<biofilm>> :: A community of symbiotic microorganisms, especially bacteria, where cells produce and embed themselves within a slimy, sticky extracellular matrix composed of various high-molecular weight biopolymers, adhering to each other and sometimes also to a substratum, which may be a biotic or abiotic surface. ^{[8]} Many bacteria can exist either as independent single cells or switch to a physiologically distinct biofilm phenotype; those that create biofilms often do so in order to shelter themselves from harmful environments. Cells residing within biofilms can easily share nutrients and communicate, and subpopulations of cells may differentiate to perform specialized functions supporting the whole biofilm. ^{[9]}
<<biomarker>> :: A measurable indicator of some biological state, especially a compound or biomolecule whose presence or absence in a biological system is a reliable sign of a normal or abnormal process, condition, or disease. ^{[10]} Direct measurements of the concentration of a particular compound or molecule in a tissue or fluid sample are often informative, but characteristic physiological, histological, or radiographic signals (e.g. a change in heart rate, or a distinct morphology under a microscope) may also serve as biomarkers. They are regularly used as predictive or diagnostic tools in clinical medicine and laboratory research.
<<biomolecular gradient>> ::
<<bivalent>>
<<blot>> :: Any of a variety of molecular biology methods by which electrophoretically or chromatographically separated DNA, RNA, or protein samples are transferred from a support medium such as a polyacrylamide or agarose gel onto an immobilizing carrier such as a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane. Some methods involve the transfer of molecules by capillary action (e.g. Southern and northern blotting), while others rely on the transport of charged molecules by electrophoresis (e.g. western blotting). The transferred molecules are then visualized by colorant staining, by autoradiography, or by probing for specific sequences or epitopes with hybridization probes or antibodies bound to chemiluminescent reporters. ^{[4]}
<<blunt end>> :: A term used to describe the end of a double-stranded DNA molecule where the terminal nucleobases on each strand are base-paired with each other, such that neither strand has a single-stranded "overhang" of unpaired bases, in contrast to a so-called " sticky end", where an overhang is created by one strand being one or more bases longer than the other. Blunt ends and sticky ends are relevant when ligating multiple DNA molecules, e.g. in restriction cloning, because sticky-ended molecules will not readily anneal to each other unless they have matching overhangs; blunt-ended molecules do not anneal in this way, so special procedures must be used to ensure that fragments with blunt ends are joined in the correct places.
<<bromodeoxyuridine>> (BUDR, BrdU) ::
<<cadastral gene>> :: A regulatory gene that restricts the expression of other genes to specific tissues or body parts in an organism, typically by producing gene products which variably inhibit or permit transcription of the other genes in different cell types. ^{[4]} The term is used most commonly in plant genetics.
<<cadherin>> ::
<<callus>> ::
<<Calvin cycle>> ::
<<candidate gene>> :: A gene whose location on a chromosome is associated with a particular phenotype (often a disease-related phenotype), and which is therefore suspected of causing or contributing to the phenotype. Candidate genes are often selected for study based on /a priori/ knowledge or speculation about their functional relevance to the trait or disease being researched.
<<canonical sequence>> See /consensus sequence/.
<<carbohydrate>> ::
<<carboxyl terminus>> See /C-terminus/.
<<carrier protein>> :: A membrane protein that functions as a transporter, binding to a solute and facilitating its movement across a membrane by undergoing a series of conformational changes. ^{[6]}
<<caspase>> ::
<<CCAAT box>> :: A highly conserved regulatory DNA sequence located approximately 75 base pairs upstream (i.e. -75) of the site of the start of transcription for many eukaryotic genes. ^{[2]}
<<cDNA>> See /complementary DNA/.
<<cell>> ::
<<cell biology>> :: The branch of biology that studies the structures, functions, processes, and properties of biological cells, the self-contained units of life common to all living organisms.
<<cell compartmentalization>> :: The subdivision of the interior of a cell into distinct, usually membrane-bound compartments, including the nucleus and organelles ( endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, chloroplasts, intracellular vesicles, etc.), a defining feature of the Eukarya. ^{[11]}
<<cell cortex>> :: A specialized layer of cytoplasmic proteins lining the inner face of the cell membrane in most eukaryotic cells, composed primarily of actin microfilaments and myosin motor proteins and usually 100--1000 nanometres thick, which functions as a modulator of membrane behavior and cell surface properties.
<<cell counting>> ::
<<cell culture>> :: The process by which living cells are grown and maintained, or "cultured", under carefully controlled conditions, generally outside of their natural environment. Optimal growth conditions vary widely for different cell types but usually consist of a suitable vessel (e.g. a culture tube or Petri dish) containing a specifically formulated substrate or growth medium that supplies all of the nutrients essential for life ( amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, etc.) plus any desirable growth factors and hormones, permits gas exchange (if necessary), and regulates the environment by maintaining consistent physico-chemical properties (e.g. pH, osmotic pressure, and temperature). Some cell types require a solid surface to which they can adhere in order to reproduce, while others can be grown freely floating in a liquid or gelatinous suspension. Most cells have a genetically determined reproduction limit, but immortalized cells will divide indefinitely if provided with optimal conditions.
<<cell cycle>> ::
<<cell division>> :: The separation of an individual parent cell into two daughter cells by any process. Cell division generally occurs by a complex, carefully structured sequence of events involving the reorganization of the parent cell's internal contents, the physical cleaving of the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, and the even distribution of contents between the two resulting cells, so that each ultimately contains approximately half of the original cell's starting material. It usually implies reproduction via the replication of the parent cell's genetic material prior to division, though cells may also divide without replicating their DNA. In prokaryotic cells, binary fission is the primary form of cell division. In eukaryotic cells, asexual division occurs by mitosis and cytokinesis, while specific lineages of cells reserved for sexual reproduction can additionally divide by meiosis. ^{[6]}
<<cell fusion>> ::
<<cell membrane>> :: The selectively permeable membrane surrounding all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, defining the outermost boundary of the cell and physically separating the cytoplasm from the extracellular environment. ^{[12]} Like all membranes, the cell membrane is a flexible, fluid, sheet-like phospholipid bilayer with membrane proteins, carbohydrates, and numerous other molecules embedded within or interacting with it from both the interior and exterior sides. Embedded molecules often have freedom to move laterally alongside the membrane's lipids. Though the cell membrane can be freely crossed by many ions, small organic molecules, and water, most other substances require active transport through special pores or channels or by endocytosis or exocytosis in order to enter or exit the cell, usually very large or electrically charged molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Besides regulating the transport of substances into and out of the cell, the cell membrane creates an organized interior space in which to perform life-sustaining activities and plays fundamental roles in all of the cell's interactions with the external environment, making it important in cell signaling, motility, defense, and division, among numerous other processes.
<<cell physiology>> ::
<<cell polarity>> ::
<<cell signaling>> :: The diverse set of processes by which cells transmit information to and receive information from themselves, other cells, or their environment. Signal transduction occurs in all cell types, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, and is critically important to the cell's ability to navigate and survive its physical surroundings. Countless mechanisms of signaling have evolved in different organisms, and these are often categorized according to the proximity between sender and recipient ( autocrine, intracrine, juxtacrine, paracrine, or endocrine).
<<cell surface receptor>> ::
<<cell wall>> ::
<<cell-free DNA (cfDNA)>> Any DNA molecule that exists outside of a cell or nucleus, freely floating in an extracellular fluid such as blood plasma.
<<cellular>> :: Of, relating to, consisting of, produced by, or resembling a cell or cells.
<<cellular differentiation>> ::
<<cellular immunity>> ::
<<cellular noise>> ::
<<cellular reprogramming>> The conversion of a fully differentiated cell from one tissue-specific cell type to another. This involves dedifferentiation to a pluripotent state; an example is the conversion of mouse somatic cells to an undifferentiated embryonic state, which relies on the transcription factors /Oct4/, /Sox2/, /Myc/, and /Klf4/. ^{[13]}
<<cellular senescence>> ::
<<centimorgan>> (cM) :: A unit for measuring genetic linkage defined as the distance between chromosomal loci for which the expected average number of intervening chromosomal crossovers in a single generation is 0.01. Though not an actual measure of physical distance, it is used to infer the actual distance between two loci based on the apparent likelihood of a crossover occurring between them.
<<central dogma of molecular biology>> :: A generalized framework for understanding the flow of genetic information between macromolecules within biological systems. The central dogma outlines the fundamental principle that the sequence information encoded in the three major classes of biopolymer--- DNA, RNA, and protein---can only be transferred between these three classes in certain ways, and not in others: specifically, information transfer between the nucleic acids and from nucleic acid to protein is possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or from protein back to either type of nucleic acid, is impossible and does not occur naturally.
<<centriole>> :: A cylindrical organelle composed of microtubules, present only in certain eukaryotes. A pair of centrioles migrate to and define the two opposite poles of a dividing cell where, as part of a centrosome, they initiate the growth of the spindle apparatus.
<<centromere>> :: A specialized DNA sequence within a chromosome that links a pair of sister chromatids. The primary function of the centromere is to act as the site of assembly for kinetochores, protein complexes which direct the attachment of spindle fibers to the centromere and facilitate segregation of the chromatids during mitosis or meiosis.
<<centromeric index>> The proportion of the total length of a chromosome encompassed by its short arm, typically expressed as a percentage; e.g. a chromosome with a centromeric index of 15 is acrocentric, with a short arm comprising only 15% of its overall length. ^{[4]}
<<centrosome>> ::
<<cfDNA>> See /cell-free DNA/.
<<channel protein>> :: A type of transmembrane protein whose shape forms an aqueous pore in a membrane, permitting the passage of specific solutes, often small ions, across the membrane in either or both directions. ^{[6]}
<<Chargaff's rules>> :: A set of axioms which state that, in the DNA of any chromosome, species, or organism, the total number of adenine ( A) residues will be approximately equal to the total number of thymine ( T) residues, and the number of guanine ( G) residues will be equal to the number of cytosine ( C) residues; accordingly, the total number of purines ( A + G) will equal the total number of pyrimidines ( T + C). These observations illustrate the highly specific nature of the complementary base-pairing that occurs in all duplex DNA molecules: even though non-standard pairings are technically possible, they are exceptionally rare because the standard ones are strongly favored in most conditions. Still, the 1:1 equivalence is seldom exact, since at any given time nucleobase ratios are inevitably distorted to some small degree by unrepaired mismatches, missing bases, and non-canonical bases. The presence of single-stranded DNA polymers also alters the proportions, as the sequence of an individual strand may contain any number of any of the bases.
<<charged tRNA>> A transfer RNA to which an amino acid has been attached; i.e. an aminoacylated tRNA. Uncharged tRNAs lack amino acids. ^{[4]}
<<chDNA>> See /chloroplast DNA/.
<<chemiosmosis>> ::
<<chemokinesis>> :: A non-directional, random change in the movement of a molecule, cell, or organism in response to a chemical stimulus, e.g. a change in speed resulting from exposure to a particular chemical compound.
<<chemotaxis>> :: A directed, non-random change in the movement of a molecule, cell, or organism in response to a chemical stimulus, e.g. towards or away from an area with a high concentration of a particular chemical compound. ^{[6]}
<<chiasma>> :: A cross-shaped junction that forms the physical point of contact between two non-sister chromatids belonging to homologous chromosomes during synapsis. As well as ensuring proper segregation of the chromosomes, these junctions are also the breakpoints at which chromosomal crossover may occur during mitosis or meiosis, which results in the reciprocal exchange of DNA between the synapsed chromatids.
<<chimerism>> :: The presence of two or more populations of cells with distinct genotypes in an individual organism, known as a /chimera/, which has developed from the fusion of cells originating from separate zygotes; each population of cells retains its own genome, such that the organism as a whole is a mixture of genetically non-identical tissues. Genetic chimerism may be inherited (e.g. by the fusion of multiple embryos during pregnancy) or acquired after birth (e.g. by allogeneic transplantation of cells, tissues, or organs from a genetically non-identical donor); in plants, it can result from grafting or errors in cell division. It is similar to but distinct from mosaicism.
<<chloroplast>> ::
<<chloroplast DNA>> (cpDNA, chDNA, ctDNA) :: The set of DNA molecules contained within chloroplasts, a type of photosynthetic plastid organelle located within the cells of some eukaryotes such as plants and algae, representing a semi-autonomous genome separate from that within the cell's nucleus. Like other types of plastid DNA, cpDNA usually exists in the form of small circular plasmids.
<<chondriome>> :: The complete set of mitochondria or of mitochondrial DNA within a cell, tissue, organism, or species.
<<chromatid>> :: One copy of a newly copied chromosome, which is joined to the original chromosome by a centromere. Paired copies of the same individual chromosome are known as sister chromatids.
<<chromatin>> :: A complex of DNA, RNA, and protein found in eukaryotic cells that is the primary substance comprising chromosomes. Chromatin functions as a means of packaging very long DNA molecules into highly organized and densely compacted shapes, which prevents the strands from becoming tangled, reinforces the DNA during cell division, helps to prevent DNA damage, and plays an important role in regulating gene expression and DNA replication.
<<chromatin immunoprecipitation>> (ChIP) ::
<<chromocenter>> A central amorphous mass of polytene chromosomes found in the nuclei of cells of the salivary glands in /Drosophila/ larvae and resulting from the fusion of heterochromatic regions surrounding the centromeres of the somatically paired chromosomes, with the distal euchromatic arms radiating outward. ^{[4]}
<<chromomere>> :: A region of a chromosome that has been locally compacted or coiled into chromatin, conspicuous under a microscope as a "bead", node, or dark-staining band, especially when contrasted with nearby uncompacted strings of DNA.
<<chromosomal crossover>> ::
<<chromosomal DNA>> DNA contained in chromosomes, as opposed to extrachromosomal DNA. The term is generally used synonymously with genomic DNA.
<<chromosomal duplication>> :: The duplication of an entire chromosome, as opposed to a segment of a chromosome or an individual gene.
<<chromosomal instability>> ::
<<chromosome>> :: A nuclear DNA molecule containing part or all of the genetic material of an organism. Chromosomes may be considered a sort of molecular "package" for carrying DNA within the nucleus of cells and, in most eukaryotes, are composed of long strands of DNA coiled with packaging proteins which bind to and condense the strands to prevent them from becoming an unmanageable tangle. Chromosomes are most easily distinguished and studied in their completely condensed forms, which only occur during cell division. Some simple organisms have only one chromosome made of circular DNA, while most eukaryotes have multiple chromosomes made of linear DNA.
<<chromosome condensation>> The process by which eukaryotic chromosomes become shorter, thicker, denser, and more conspicuous under a microscope during prophase due to systemic coiling and supercoiling of chromatic strands of DNA in preparation for cell division.
<<chromosome segregation>> :: The process by which sister chromatids or paired homologous chromosomes separate from each other and migrate to opposite sides of the dividing cell during mitosis or meiosis.
<<chromosome walking>> See /primer walking/.
<<cilium>> :: A slender, thread-like, membrane-bound projection extending from the surface of a eukaryotic cell, longer than a microvillus but shorter than a flagellum. Most eukaryotic cells have at least one /primary cilium/ serving sensory or signaling functions; some cells employ thousands of /motile cilia/ covering their entire surface in order to achieve locomotion or to move extracellular material past the cell.
<<circular DNA>> Any DNA molecule, single-stranded or double-stranded, which forms a continuous closed loop without ends; e.g. bacterial chromosomes, mitochondrial and plastid DNA, as well as many other varieties of extrachromosomal DNA, including plasmids and some viral DNA. Contrast /linear DNA/.
<<circulating tumor DNA>> (ctDNA) :: Any extracellular DNA fragments derived from tumor cells which are circulating freely in the bloodstream.
<</cis/>> On the same side; adjacent to; acting from the same molecule. Contrast /trans/.
<</cis/-acting>> Affecting a gene or sequence on the same nucleic acid molecule. A locus or sequence within a particular DNA molecule such as a chromosome is said to be /cis/-acting if it influences or acts upon other sequences located within short distances (i.e. physically nearby, usually but not necessarily downstream) on the same molecule or chromosome; or, in the broadest sense, if it influences or acts upon other sequences located anywhere (not necessarily within a short distance) on the same chromosome of a homologous pair. /Cis/-acting factors are often involved in the regulation of gene expression by acting to inhibit or to facilitate transcription. Contrast /trans-acting/.
<</cis/-dominant mutation>> A mutation occurring within a  /cis/-regulatory element (such as an operator) which alters the functioning of a nearby gene or genes on the same chromosome. /Cis/-dominant mutations affect the expression of genes because they occur at sites that control transcription rather than within the genes themselves.
<<cisgenesis>> ::
<</cis/-regulatory element>> (CRE) :: Any sequence or region of non-coding DNA which regulates the transcription of nearby genes (e.g. a promoter, operator, silencer, or enhancer), typically by serving as a binding site for one or more transcription factors. Contrast /trans-regulatory/.
<<cisterna>> :: Any of a class of flattened, membrane-bound vesicles or saccules of the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. By traveling through one or more cisternae, each of which contains a distinct set of enzymes, newly created proteins and polysaccharides undergo chemical modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are used as packaging signals to direct their transport to specific destinations within the cell. ^{[14]}
<<cistron>> ::
<<citric acid cycle>> ::
<<classical genetics>> :: The branch of genetics based solely on observation of the visible results of reproductive acts, as opposed to that made possible by the modern techniques and methodologies of molecular biology. Contrast /molecular genetics/.
<<cleavage>>
<<cleavage furrow>> ::
<<clonal selection>> ::
<<cloning>> :: The process of producing, either naturally or artificially, individual organisms or cells which are genetically identical to each other. Clones are the result of all forms of asexual reproduction, and cells that undergo mitosis produce daughter cells that are clones of the parent cell and of each other. Cloning may also refer to biotechnology methods which artificially create copies of organisms or cells, or, in molecular cloning, copies of DNA fragments or other molecules.
<<closed chromatin>> See /heterochromatin/.
<<coactivator>> :: A type of coregulator that increases the expression of one or more genes by binding to an activator.
<<coding strand>> :: The strand of a double-stranded DNA molecule whose nucleotide sequence corresponds directly to that of the RNA transcript produced during transcription (except that thymine bases are substituted with uracil bases in the RNA molecule). Though it is not itself transcribed, the coding strand is by convention the strand used when displaying a DNA sequence because of the direct analogy between its sequence and the codons of the RNA product. Contrast /template strand/; see also /sense/.
<<codon>> :: A series of three consecutive nucleotides in a coding region of a nucleic acid sequence. Each of these triplets codes for a particular amino acid or stop signal during protein synthesis. DNA and RNA molecules are each written in a language using four "letters" (four different nucleobases), but the language used to construct proteins includes 20 "letters" (20 different amino acids). Codons provide the key that allows these two languages to be translated into each other. In general, each codon corresponds to a single amino acid (or stop signal). The full set of codons is called the genetic code.
<<codon usage bias>> :: The preferential use of a particular codon to code for a particular amino acid rather than alternative codons that are synonymous for the same amino acid, as evidenced by differences between organisms in the frequencies of the synonymous codons occurring in their coding DNA. Because the genetic code is degenerate, most amino acids can be specified by multiple codons. Nevertheless, certain codons tend to be overrepresented (and others underrepresented) in different species.
<<coenocyte>> :: A multinucleate mass of cytoplasm bounded by a cell wall and resulting from continuous cytoplasmic growth and repeated nuclear division without cytokinesis, found in some species of algae and fungi, e.g. /Vaucheria/ and /Physarum/. ^{[11]}
<<coenzyme>> :: A relatively small, independent molecule which associates with a specific enzyme and participates in the reaction that the enzyme catalyzes, often by forming a covalent bond with the substrate. Examples include biotin, NAD ^{+}, and coenzyme A. ^{[6]}
<<coenzyme A>> (CoA) ::
<<cofactor>> :: Any non-protein organic compound that is bound to an enzyme. Cofactors are required for the initiation of catalysis.
<<comparative genomic hybridization>> (CGH) ::
<<competence>> ::
<<complementarity>> :: A property of nucleic acid biopolymers whereby two polymeric chains or " strands" aligned antiparallel to each other will tend to form base pairs consisting of hydrogen bonds between the individual nucleobases comprising each chain, with each type of nucleobase pairing almost exclusively with one other type of nucleobase; e.g. in double-stranded DNA molecules, A pairs only with T and C pairs only with G. Strands that are paired in such a way, and the bases themselves, are said to be /complementary/. The degree of complementarity between two strands strongly influences the stability of the duplex molecule; certain sequences may also be internally complementary, which can result in a single strand binding to itself. Complementarity is fundamental to the mechanisms governing DNA replication, transcription, and DNA repair.
<<complementary DNA>> (cDNA) :: DNA that is synthesized from a single-stranded RNA template (typically mRNA or miRNA) in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. cDNA is produced both naturally by retroviruses and artificially in certain laboratory techniques, particularly molecular cloning. In bioinformatics, the term may also be used to refer to the sequence of an mRNA transcript expressed as its DNA coding strand counterpart (i.e. with thymine replacing uracil).
<<complementation>> ::
<<compound X>> See /attached X/.
<<conditional expression>> The controlled, inducible expression of a transgene, either /in vitro/ or /in vivo/.
<<confluency>> ::
<<congression>> The movement of chromosomes to the spindle equator during the prometaphase and metaphase stages of mitosis. ^{[4]}
<<consensus sequence>> :: A calculated order of the most frequent residues (of either nucleotides or amino acids) found at each position in a common sequence alignment and obtained by comparing multiple closely related sequence alignments.
<<conservative replication>> A hypothetical mode of DNA replication in which the two parental strands of the original double-stranded DNA molecule ultimately remain complemented to each other at the end of the replication process, and the two daughter strands end up forming their own separate molecule; hence one molecule is composed of both of the starting strands while the other is composed entirely of newly synthesized strands. This is in contrast to semiconservative replication, in which each molecule is a hybrid of one old and one new strand.See also /dispersive replication/.
<<conserved sequence>> :: A nucleic acid or protein sequence that is highly similar or identical across many species or within a genome, indicating that it has remained relatively unchanged through a long period of evolutionary time.
<<conspecific>> :: Belonging to the same species.
<<constitutive expression>> 1.  The continuous transcription of a gene, as opposed to facultative expression, in which a gene is only transcribed as needed. A gene that is transcribed continuously is called a /constitutive gene/.
<<contact inhibition>> ::
<<contig>> :: A continuous sequence of genomic DNA generated by assembling cloned fragments by means of their overlapping sequences. ^{[7]}
<<cooperativity>> ::
<<copy DNA (cDNA)>> See /complementary DNA/.
<<copy error>> A mutation resulting from a mistake made during DNA replication. ^{[4]}
<<copy-number variation>> (CNV) :: A phenomenon in which sections of a genome are repeated and the number of repeats varies between individuals in the population, usually as a result of duplication or deletion events that affect entire genes or sections of chromosomes. Copy-number variations play an important role in generating genetic variation within a population.
<<coregulator>> A protein that works together with one or more transcription factors to regulate gene expression.
<<corepressor>> :: A type of coregulator that reduces (represses) the expression of one or more genes by binding to and activating a repressor.
<<cosmid>> ::
<<cpDNA>> See /chloroplast DNA/.
<<CpG island>> :: A region of a genome in which CpG sites occur repetitively or with high frequency.
<<CpG site>> :: A sequence of DNA in which a cytosine nucleotide is immediately followed by a guanine nucleotide on the same strand in the 5'-to-3' direction; the "p" in CpG refers simply to the intervening phosphate group linking the two consecutive nucleotides.
<<CRISPR gene editing>> ::
<<crista>> ::
<<crossing over>> See /chromosomal crossover/.
<<crosslink>> :: An abnormal chemical bond between two or more nucleobases on opposite strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule ( /interstrand/), or between bases on the same strand ( /intrastrand/), specifically via the formation of covalent bonds that are stronger than the hydrogen bonds of base pairing. Crosslinks can be generated by a variety of exogenous and endogenous agents, and tend to interfere with normal cellular processes such as DNA replication and transcription. They are common targets of DNA repair pathways.
<<cryptic unstable transcript>> (CUT) ::
<<ctDNA>> 1.  An abbreviation of circulating tumor DNA.
<<C-terminus>> :: The end of a linear chain of amino acids (i.e. a peptide) that is terminated by the free carboxyl group ( --COOH) of the last amino acid to be added to the chain during translation. This amino acid is said to be /C-terminal/. By convention, sequences, domains, active sites, or any other structure positioned nearer to the C-terminus of the polypeptide or the folded protein it forms relative to others are described as downstream. Contrast /N-terminus/.
<<cut>>
<<C-value>> :: The total amount of DNA contained within a haploid nucleus (e.g. a gamete) of a particular organism or species, expressed in number of base pairs or in units of mass (typically picograms); or, equivalently, one-half the amount in a diploid somatic cell. For simple diploid eukaryotes the term is often used interchangeably with genome size, but in certain cases, e.g. in hybrid polyploids descended from parents of different species, the C-value may actually represent two or more distinct genomes contained within the same nucleus. C-values apply only to genomic DNA, and notably exclude extranuclear DNA.
<<C-value enigma>> :: A term used to describe a diverse variety of questions regarding the immense variation in nuclear C-value or genome size among eukaryotic species, in particular the observation that genome size does not correlate with the perceived complexity of organisms, nor necessarily with the number of genes they possess; for example, many single-celled protists have genomes containing thousands of times more DNA than the human genome. This was considered paradoxical until the discovery that eukaryotic genomes consist mostly of non-coding DNA, which lacks genes entirely. The focus of the enigma has since shifted to understanding why and how genomes came to be filled with so much non-coding DNA, and why some genomes have a higher gene content than others.
<<cyclic adenosine monophosphate>> (cAMP) ::
<<cyclosis>> See /cytoplasmic streaming/.
<<cytidine>> ( C, Cyd) :: One of the four standard nucleosides used in RNA molecules, consisting of a cytosine base with its N _{9} nitrogen bonded to the C _{1} carbon of a ribose sugar. Cytosine bonded to deoxyribose is known as deoxycytidine, which is the version used in DNA.
<<cytochemistry>> :: The branch of cell biology involving the detection and identification of the various structures and components within cells by means of biochemical analysis and visualization, in particular the localization of cellular constituents by using techniques such as chemical staining and immunostaining, spectrophotometry and spectroscopy, radioautography, and electron microscopy.
<<cytogenetics>> :: The branch of genetics that studies how chromosomes influence and relate to cell behavior and function, particularly during mitosis and meiosis.
<<cytokine>> ::
<<cytokinesis>> :: The final stage of cell division in both mitosis and meiosis, usually immediately following the division of the nucleus, during which the cytoplasm of the parent cell is cleaved and divided approximately evenly between two daughter cells. In animal cells, this process occurs by the closing of a microfilament contractile ring in the equatorial region of the dividing cell. Contrast /karyokinesis/.
<<cytology>> :: The study of the morphology, processes, and life history of living cells, particularly by means of light and electron microscopy. ^{[11]} The term is also sometimes used as a synonym for the broader field of cell biology.
<<cytolysis>> See /lysis/.
<<cytometer>> ::
<<cytomics>> :: The interdisciplinary field that studies cell biology, cytology, and biochemistry at the level of an individual cell by making use of single-cell molecular techniques and advanced microscopy to visualize the interactions of cellular components /in vivo/. ^{[15]}
<<cytoplasm>> ::
<<cytoplasmic streaming>> :: The flow of the cytoplasm inside a cell, driven by forces exerted upon cytoplasmic fluids by the cytoskeleton. This flow functions partly to speed up the transport of molecules and organelles suspended in the cytoplasm to different parts of the cell, which would otherwise have to rely on passive diffusion for movement. It is most commonly observed in very large eukaryotic cells, for which there is a greater need for transport efficiency.
<<cytoplast>> :: An enucleated eukaryotic cell; or all other cellular components besides the nucleus (i.e. the cell membrane, cytoplasm, organelles, etc.) considered collectively. The term is most often used in the context of nuclear transfer experiments, during which the cytoplast can sometimes remain viable in the absence of a nucleus for up to 48 hours. ^{[16]}
<<cytosine>> ( C) :: A pyrimidine nucleobase used as one of the four standard nucleobases in both DNA and RNA molecules. Cytosine forms a base pair with guanine.
<<cytosol>> :: The soluble aqueous phase of the cytoplasm, in which small particles such as ribosomes, proteins, nucleic acids, and many other molecules are suspended or dissolved, excluding larger structures and organelles such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum. ^{[11]}
<<daughter cell>> ::
<</de novo/ mutation>> :: A spontaneous mutation in the genome of an individual organism that is new to that organism's lineage, having first appeared in a germ cell of one of the organism's parents or in the fertilized egg that develops into the organism; i.e. a mutation that was not present in either parent's genome. ^{[4]}
<</de novo/ synthesis>> :: The assembly of a synthetic nucleic acid sequence from free nucleotides without relying on an existing template strand, i.e. /de novo/, by any of a variety of laboratory methods. /De novo/ synthesis makes it theoretically possible to construct completely artificial molecules with no naturally occurring equivalent, and no restrictions on size or sequence. It is performed routinely in the commercial production of customized, made-to-order oligonucleotide sequences such as primers.
<<deacetylation>> ::
<<decellularization>> ::
<<degeneracy>> :: The redundancy of the genetic code, exhibited as the multiplicity of different codons that specify the same amino acid. For example, in the standard genetic code, the amino acid serine is specified by six unique codons ( UCA, UCG, UCC, UCU, AGU, and AGC). Codon degeneracy accounts for the existence of synonymous mutations.
<<degranulation>> ::
<<deletion>> :: A type of mutation in which one or more nucleotides are removed from a nucleic acid sequence.
<<demethylation>> ::
<<denaturation>> :: The process by which nucleic acids or proteins lose their quaternary, tertiary, and/or secondary structures, either reversibly or irreversibly, through the application of some external chemical or mechanical stress, e.g. by heating, agitation, or exposure to a strong acid or base, all of which can disrupt intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and thereby change or destroy chemical activity. Denatured proteins may be both a cause and a consequence of cell death. Denaturation may also be a normal process; the denaturation of double-stranded DNA molecules, for example, which breaks the hydrogen bonds between base pairs and causes the separation of the duplex molecule into two single strands, is a necessary step in DNA replication and transcription and hence is routinely performed by enzymes such as helicases. The same mechanism is also fundamental to laboratory methods such as PCR.
<<deoxyadenosine>> :: One of the four standard deoxyribonucleosides used in DNA molecules, consisting of an adenine base with its N _{9} nitrogen bonded to the C _{1} carbon of a deoxyribose sugar. Adenine bonded to ribose forms an alternate compound known simply as adenosine, which is used in RNA.
<<deoxycytidine>> :: One of the four standard deoxyribonucleosides used in DNA molecules, consisting of a cytosine base with its N _{9} nitrogen bonded to the C _{1} carbon of a deoxyribose sugar. Cytosine bonded to ribose forms an alternate compound known simply as cytidine, which is used in RNA.
<<deoxyguanosine>> :: One of the four standard deoxyribonucleosides used in DNA molecules, consisting of a guanine base with its N _{9} nitrogen bonded to the C _{1} carbon of a deoxyribose sugar. Guanine bonded to ribose forms an alternate compound known simply as guanosine, which is used in RNA.
<<deoxyribonuclease>> (DNase) :: Any of a class of nuclease enzymes which catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester bonds in DNA molecules, thereby severing strands of deoxyribonucleotides and causing the degradation of DNA polymers into smaller components. Compare /ribonuclease/.
<<deoxyribonucleic acid>> (DNA) :: A polymeric nucleic acid molecule composed of a series of deoxyribonucleotides, each of which incorporates one of four canonical nucleobases: adenine ( A), guanine ( G), cytosine ( C), and thymine ( T). DNA is most often found in double-stranded form, which consists of two complementary antiparallel nucleotide chains in which each of the nucleobases on each individual strand is paired via hydrogen bonding with one on the opposite strand; this structure commonly occurs in the shape of a double helix. DNA can also exist in single-stranded form. By storing and encoding genetic information in the sequence of its nucleotides, DNA serves as the universal molecular basis of biological inheritance and the fundamental template from which all proteins, cells, and living organisms are constructed.
<<deoxyribonucleotide>> :: A nucleotide containing deoxyribose as its pentose sugar component, and the monomeric subunit of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules. Deoxyribonucleotides canonically incorporate any of four nitrogenous bases: adenine ( A), guanine ( G), cytosine ( C), and thymine ( T). Compare /ribonucleotide/.
<<deoxyribose>> :: A monosaccharide sugar derived from ribose by the loss of a single oxygen atom. D-deoxyribose, in its pentose ring form, is one of three primary functional groups of deoxyribonucleotides and hence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules.
<<deoxythymidine>> See /thymidine/.
<<dephosphorylation>> ::
<<desmosome>> :: A specialized cell junction between neighboring epithelial cells in which the cells are held together by a network of keratin filaments and structural proteins bridging the gap between the plasma membranes. ^{[17]}
<<destination vector>>
<<desynapsis>> The failure of homologous chromosomes that have synapsed normally during pachynema to remain paired during diplonema. Desynapsis is usually caused by the improper formation of chiasmata. ^{[4]} Contrast /asynapsis/.
<<developmental biology>> ::
<<diakinesis>> :: In meiosis, the fifth and final substage of prophase I, following diplonema and preceding metaphase I. During diakinesis, the chromosomes are further condensed, the two centrosomes reach opposite poles of the cell, and the spindle apparatus begins to extend from the poles to the equator. ^{[4]}
<<dicentric>> (of a linear chromosome or chromosome fragment) Having two centromeres instead of the normal one. ^{[2]}
<<differentiation>> ::
<<dimer>> :: A molecular aggregate consisting of two subunits. The term is often used to describe a protein complex composed of two proteins, either the same protein (a homodimer) or different proteins (a heterodimer); or to an individual protein composed of two polypeptides. Compare /monomer/, /trimer/, and /tetramer/.
<<dinucleotide>> :: Any two nucleotides which are immediately adjacent to each other on the same strand of a nucleic acid molecule.
<<diploid>> :: (of a cell or organism) Having two homologous copies of each chromosome. Contrast /haploid/ and /polyploid/.
<<diplonema>> :: In meiosis, the fourth of the five substages of prophase I, following pachynema and preceding diakinesis. During diplonema, the synaptonemal complex disassembles and the paired homologous chromosomes begin to separate from one another, though they remain tightly bound at the chiasmata where crossover has occurred.
<<direct repeat>> :: Any two or more repetitions of a specific sequence of nucleotides occurring in the same orientation (i.e. in precisely the same order and not inverted) and on the same strand, either separated by intervening nucleotides or not. An example is the sequence *TACCG* nnnnnn *TACCG*, in which *TACCG* occurs twice, though separated by six nucleotides that are not part of the repeated sequence. A direct repeat in which the repeats are immediately adjacent to each other is known as a tandem repeat.
<<directionality>> :: The end-to-end chemical orientation of a single linear strand or sequence of a nucleic acid polymer or a polypeptide. The nomenclature used to indicate nucleic acid directionality is based on the chemical convention of identifying individual carbon atoms in the ribose or deoxyribose sugars of nucleotides, specifically the 5' carbon and 3' carbon of the pentose ring. The sequence of nucleotides in a polymeric chain may be read or interpreted in the 5'-to-3' direction -- i.e. starting from the terminal nucleotide in which the 5' carbon is not connected to another nucleotide, and proceeding to the other terminal nucleotide, in which the 3' carbon is not connected to another nucleotide -- or in the opposite 3'-to-5' direction. Most types of nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription, work exclusively in the 5'-to-3' direction, because the enzymes involved can only catalyze the addition of free nucleotides to the open 3'-end of the previous nucleotide in the chain. Because of this, the convention when writing any nucleic acid sequence is to present it in the 5'-to-3' direction from left to right. In double-stranded nucleic acids, the two paired strands must be oriented in opposite directions in order to base-pair with each other. Polypeptide directionality is similarly based on labeling the functional groups in amino acids, specifically the amino group, which forms the N-terminus, and the carboxyl group, which forms the C-terminus; amino acid sequences are assembled in the N-to-C direction during translation, and are almost always written in the same direction.
<<disaccharide>> ::
<<dispersive replication>>
<<dissimilatory process>> Any exergonic process of microbial catabolism by which redox-active chemical species participate in oxidation-reduction reactions (exchange of electrons) to provide the cell with energy needed for sustaining metabolic activities. External substances are absorbed by the cell from its environment and then decomposed to release energy, with the byproducts subsequently excreted out of the cell. This is in contrast to an assimilatory process, in which the atoms of the external substances are reused in the synthesis of biomolecules or the fabrication of cellular components.
<<distance measure>> Any quantity used to measure the dissimilarity between the gene expression levels of different genes. ^{[18]}
<<DNA>> See /deoxyribonucleic acid/.
<<DNA barcoding>> :: A method of taxonomic identification in which short DNA sequences from one or more specific genes are isolated from unidentified samples and then aligned with sequences from a reference library in order to uniquely identify the species or other taxon from which the samples originated. The sequences used in the comparison are chosen carefully from genes that are both widely conserved and that show greater variation between species than within species, e.g. the cytochrome c oxidase gene for eukaryotes or certain ribosomal RNA genes for prokaryotes. These genes are present in nearly all living organisms but tend to evolve different mutations in different species, such that a unique sequence variant can be linked to one particular species, effectively creating a unique identifier akin to a retail barcode. DNA barcoding allows unknown specimens to be identified from otherwise indistinct tissues or body parts, where identification by morphology would be difficult or impossible, and the library of organismal barcodes is now comprehensive enough that even organisms previously unknown to science can often be phylogenetically classified with confidence. The simultaneous identification of multiple different species from a mixed sample is known as /metabarcoding/.
<<DNA condensation>> :: The process of compacting very long DNA molecules into densely packed, orderly configurations such as chromosomes, either /in vivo/ or /in vitro/.
<<DNA fingerprinting>> ::
<<DNA methylation>> ::
<<DNA microarray>> :: A high-throughput technology used to measure expression levels of mRNA transcripts or to detect certain changes in nucleotide sequence. It consists of an array of thousands of microscopic spots of DNA oligonucleotides, called /features/, each containing picomoles of a specific DNA sequence. This can be a short section of a gene or any other DNA element, and is used as a probe to hybridize a cDNA, cRNA or genomic DNA sample (called a /target/) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by fluorescence-based detection of fluorophore-labeled targets.
<<DNA polymerase>> :: Any of a class of enzymes which synthesize DNA molecules from individual deoxyribonucleotides. DNA polymerases are essential for DNA replication and usually work in pairs to create identical copies of the two strands of an original double-stranded molecule. They build long chains of DNA by adding nucleotides one at a time to the 3'-end of a DNA strand, usually relying on the template provided by the complementary strand to copy the nucleotide sequence faithfully.
<<DNA repair>> :: The set of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects structural damage or mutations in the DNA molecules that encode its genome. The ability of a cell to repair its DNA is vital to the integrity of the genome and the normal functionality of the organism.
<<DNA replication>> :: The process by which a DNA molecule copies itself, producing two identical copies of one original DNA molecule.
<<DNA sequencing>> :: The process of determining, by any of a variety of different methods and technologies, the order of the bases in the long chain of nucleotides that constitutes a sequence of DNA.
<<DNA turnover>> Any mechanism by which DNA sequences are exchanged non-reciprocally (e.g. via gene conversion, transposition, or unequal crossing-over) that causes continual fluctuations in the copy number of DNA motifs during an organism's lifetime. Such mechanisms are often major drivers of speciation between populations. ^{[16]}
<<DNA-binding domain>> (DBD) ::
<<DNA-binding protein>> (DBP) :: Any polypeptide or protein containing one or more domains capable of interacting chemically with one or more parts of a DNA molecule, and consequently having a specific or general affinity for single- and/or double-stranded DNA. DNA-binding activity often depends on the presence and physical accessibility of a specific nucleobase sequence, and mostly occurs at the major groove, since it exposes more of the functional groups that uniquely identify the bases. Binding is also influenced by the spatial conformation of the DNA chain and the occupancy of other proteins near the binding site; many proteins cannot bind to DNA without first undergoing structural changes induced by interactions with other molecules.
<<DNase>> See /deoxyribonuclease/.
<<domain>> ::
<<donor vector>>
<<dosage compensation>> :: Any mechanism by which organisms neutralize the large difference in gene dosage caused by the presence of differing numbers of sex chromosomes in the different sexes, thereby equalizing the expression of sex-linked genes so that the members of each sex receive the same or similar amounts of the products of such genes. An example is X-inactivation in female mammals.
<<double helix>> :: The shape most commonly assumed by double-stranded nucleic acid molecules, resembling a ladder that has been twisted upon its long axis, with the rungs of the ladder consisting of paired nucleobases. This secondary structure is the most energetically stable conformation of the double-stranded forms of both DNA and RNA under most naturally occurring conditions, arising as a consequence of the primary structure of the phosphodiester backbone and the stacking of the nucleotides bonded to it. In B-DNA, the most common DNA variant found in nature, the double helix has a right-handed twist with about 10 base pairs per full turn, and the molecular geometry results in an alternating pattern of "grooves" of differing widths (a major groove and a minor groove) between the parallel backbones.
<<double-strand break>> (DSB) :: The loss of continuity of the phosphate-sugar backbone in both strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule, in particular when the two breaks occur at sites that are directly across from or very close to each other on the complementary strands. ^{[16]} Contrast /single-strand break/.
<<double-stranded>> Composed of two antiparallel, complementary nucleic acid molecules or strands (either DNA--DNA, RNA--RNA, or a DNA--RNA hybrid) which are held together by hydrogen bonds between the complementary nucleobases of each strand, known as base pairing. Compare /single-stranded/.
<<double-stranded DNA>> (dsDNA) :: Any DNA molecule that is composed of two antiparallel, complementary deoxyribonucleotide polymers, known as strands, which are bonded together by hydrogen bonds between the complementary nucleobases. Though it is possible for DNA to exist as a single strand, it is generally more stable and more common in double-stranded form. In most cases, the complementary base pairing causes the twin strands to coil around each other in the shape of a double helix.
<<double-stranded RNA>> (dsRNA) :: Any RNA molecule that is composed of two antiparallel, complementary ribonucleotide polymers, known as strands, which are bonded together by hydrogen bonds between the complementary nucleobases. Though RNA usually occurs in single-stranded form, it is also capable of forming duplexes in the same way as DNA; an example is an mRNA transcript pairing with an antisense version of the same transcript, which effectively silences the gene from which the mRNA was transcribed by preventing translation. As in dsDNA, the base pairing in dsRNA usually causes the twin strands to coil around each other in the shape of a double helix.
<<downregulation>> Any process, natural or artificial, which decreases the level of gene expression of a certain gene. A gene which is observed to be expressed at relatively low levels (such as by detecting lower levels of its mRNA transcripts) in one sample compared to another sample is said to be /downregulated/. Contrast /upregulation/.
<<downstream>> Towards or closer to the 3'-end of a chain of nucleotides, or to the C-terminus of a peptide chain. Contrast /upstream/.
<<dsDNA>> See /double-stranded DNA/.
<<dsRNA>> See /double-stranded RNA/.
<<duplex>> See /double-stranded/.
<<duplication>> The production of a second copy of part or all of a nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, either naturally or artificially, and the retention of both copies; especially when both the copy and the original sequence are retained /in situ/ within the same molecule, often but not necessarily adjacent to each other. See also /gene duplication/, /chromosomal duplication/, and /repeat/.
<<dyad>> See /sister chromatids/.
<<dysplasia>> :: A change in the growth, behavior, or organization of cells within a tissue, or the presence of cells of an abnormal type, such that the tissue becomes disordered, ^{[6]} an event which often precedes the development of cancer; the abnormal growth or development of a tissue or organ.
<<eat-me signal>> :: A molecule exposed on the surface of a cell which effectively tags the cell for phagocytosis, inducing phagocytes to engulf or "eat" it. The presence of oxidized phospholipids or phosphatidylserine, or the absence of sialic acid from cell surface glycoproteins or glycolipids, are all commonly used as eat-me signals in certain cell types. See also /find-me signal/.
<<electron transport chain>> ::
<<electroporation>> :: A molecular biology technique in which a strong electric field is applied to living cells in order to temporarily increase the permeability of their cell membranes, allowing exogenous nucleic acids, proteins, or chemical compounds to easily pass through the membrane and thereby enter the cells. It is a common method of achieving transformation and transfection.
<<elongation>> The linear growth of a nucleic acid polymer by the sequential addition of individual nucleotide monomers to a nascent strand, e.g. during transcription or replication, especially when it occurs by complementary pairing with a template strand. The term is often used to describe steps in certain laboratory techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction.
<<embryo>> ::
<<emergenesis>> :: The quality of genetic traits that results from a specific configuration of interacting genes, rather than simply their combination.
<<endocytosis>> :: Any process by which a substance is actively uptaken by or brought inside of a cell, crossing the plasma membrane from an extracellular space into an intracellular space, which includes the subclasses of pinocytosis, phagocytosis, and receptor-mediated processes. All of these involve surrounding an extracellular molecule, protein, or even another cell or organism with an extension or invagination of the cell membrane, which then "buds off" or separates from the rest of the membrane on the cytoplasmic side, forming a membrane-enclosed vesicle containing the ingested materials. By this mechanism the material can cross the lipid bilayer without being exposed to the hydrophobic space in between, instead remaining suspended in the fluid of the extracellular space. Many large, polar macromolecules which cannot simply diffuse across the membrane, such as metabolites and hormones, are transported into the cell by endocytosis. It is distinguished from alternative routes such as passing through protein channels or being chaperoned by transport proteins. The reverse process is called exocytosis.
<<endomembrane>> :: Any membrane surrounding an intracellular organelle or vesicle, e.g. that of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, vacuole, nucleus (the nuclear envelope), etc. ^{[11]}
<<endonuclease>> :: Any enzyme whose activity is to cleave phosphodiester bonds within a chain of nucleotides, including those that cleave relatively nonspecifically (without regard to sequence) and those that cleave only at very specific sequences (so-called restriction endonucleases). When recognition of a specific sequence is required, endonucleases make their cuts in the middle of the sequence. Contrast /exonuclease/.
<<endoplasmic reticulum>> (ER) ::
<<endosome>> ::
<<enhancer>> :: A region of DNA near a gene that can be bound by an activator to increase gene expression or by a repressor to decrease expression.
<<enhancer RNA>> (eRNA) :: A subclass of long non-coding RNAs transcribed from regions of DNA containing enhancer sequences. The expression of a given eRNA generally correlates with the activity of the corresponding enhancer in enhancing transcription of its target genes, suggesting that eRNAs play an active role in gene regulation in /cis/ or in /trans/.
<<enucleate>> To artificially remove the nucleus from a cell, e.g. by micromanipulation in the laboratory or by destroying it through irradiation with ultraviolet light, rendering the cell anucleate. ^{[11]}
<<envagination>>
<<enzyme>> :: A protein which acts as a catalyst for a biological process by accelerating a specific chemical reaction, typically by binding one or more substrate molecules and decreasing the activation energy necessary for the initiation of a particular reaction involving the substrate(s). Enzymatic catalysis often results in the chemical conversion of the substrate(s) into one or more products, which then inhibit or permit subsequent reactions. All metabolic pathways consist of a series of individual reactions which each depend upon one or more specific enzymes to drive them forward at rates fast enough to sustain life.
<<epigenetics>> ::

<<euchromatin>> :: A relatively open, lightly compacted form of chromatin in which DNA is only sporadically bound in nucleosomes and thus broadly accessible to binding and manipulation by proteins and other molecules. Euchromatic regions of a genome are often enriched in genes and actively undergoing transcription, in contrast to heterochromatin, which is relatively gene-poor, nucleosome-rich, and less accessible to transcription machinery.
<<euploidy>> :: The condition of a cell or organism having an abnormal number of complete sets of chromosomes, possibly excluding the sex chromosomes. Euploidy differs from aneuploidy, in which a cell or organism has an abnormal number of one or more specific individual chromosomes.
<<evolution>> :: The change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. In the most traditional sense, it occurs by changes in the frequencies of alleles in a population's gene pool.
<</ex vivo/>> Occurring outside of a cell or organism, as with observations made or experiments performed in or on cells or tissues which have been isolated or removed from their natural context to an external environment (usually a carefully controlled environment with minimal alteration of natural conditions, such as a cell culture being grown in a laboratory). This is in contrast to /in vivo/ observations, which are made in an entirely natural context.
<<excision>> The enzymatic removal of a polynucleotide sequence from one or more strands of a nucleic acid, or of a polypeptide sequence from a protein, typically implying both the breaking of the polymeric molecule in two locations and the subsequent rejoining of the two breakpoints after the sequence between them has been removed. The term may be used to describe a wide variety of processes performed by distinct enzymes, including most splicing and DNA repair pathways. ^{[4]}
<<exocytosis>> :: Any active transport process by which a substance is secreted from or transported out of a cell, crossing the plasma membrane from the interior of the cell into the extracellular space, especially that which occurs by the fusion of the membrane surrounding a secretory vesicle with the larger cell membrane. This fusion causes the intra-vesicular space to merge with the extracellular fluid, releasing the vesicle's contents on the exterior side of the cell without exposing them to the hydrophobic space between the lipid bilayer. More narrowly the term may refer in particular to the bulk transport of a large amount of molecules out of the cell all at once, often metabolites or hormones which are too large and polar to passively diffuse across the membrane themselves. The reverse process, whereby materials are invaginated into the cell, is known as endocytosis.
<<exome>> :: The entire set of exons within a particular genome, including untranslated regions of mature mRNAs as well as coding regions.
<<exon>> :: Any part of a gene that encodes a part of the final mature messenger RNA produced by that gene after introns have been removed by alternative splicing. The term refers to both the sequence as it exists within a DNA molecule and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.
<<exon skipping>> ::
<<exonuclease>> :: Any enzyme whose activity is to cleave phosphodiester bonds within a chain of nucleotides, including those that cleave only upon recognition of a specific sequence (so-called restriction exonucleases). Exonucleases make their cuts at either the 3' or 5'-end of the sequence (rather than in the middle, as with endonucleases).
<<exosome>> 1.  ( protein complex) An intracellular multi-protein complex which serves the function of degrading various types of RNA molecules.
<<exosome complex>> :: An intracellular multi-protein complex which serves the function of degrading various types of RNA molecules.

<<extracellular>> :: Outside the plasma membrane of a cell or cells; i.e. located or occurring externally to a cell. Contrast /intracellular/; see also /intercellular/.
<<extracellular matrix>> (ECM) :: The network of interacting macromolecules and minerals secreted by and existing outside of and between cells in multicellular structures such as tissues and biofilms, forming a hydrated, mesh-like, semi-solid suspension which not only holds the cells together in an organized fashion but also provides structural and biochemical support, acting as an elastic, compressible buffer against external stresses as well as both regulating and influencing numerous aspects of cell behavior, among them cell adhesion, motility, metabolism, division, and cell-to-cell communication. The composition and properties of the ECM vary enormously between organisms and tissue types, but generally it takes the form of a polysaccharide gel in which various fibrous proteins (especially collagen and elastin), enzymes, and glycoproteins are embedded. Cells themselves both produce the matrix components and respond constantly to local matrix composition, a source of environmental feedback which is critical for differentiation, tissue organization, and development. ^{[11]} ^{[19]}
<<extrachromosomal DNA>> :: Any DNA that is not found in chromosomes or in the nucleus of a cell and hence is not genomic DNA. This may include the DNA contained in plasmids or organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts, or, in the broadest sense, DNA introduced by viral infection. Extrachromosomal DNA usually shows significant structural differences from nuclear DNA in the same organism.
<<facultative expression>> The transcription of a gene only as needed, as opposed to constitutive expression, in which a gene is transcribed continuously. A gene that is transcribed as needed is called a /facultative gene/.

<<fixation>> 1.  ( histology) The preservation of biological material by treating it with a chemical fixative that prevents or delays the natural postmortem processes of decay (e.g. autolysis and putrefaction) which would otherwise eventually cause cells, tissues, and biomolecules to lose their characteristic structures and properties. Biological specimens are usually fixed with the broad objective of arresting or slowing biochemical reactions for long enough to study them in detail, essentially 'freezing' cellular processes in their natural state at a specific point in time, while minimizing disruption to existing structures and arrangements, all of which can improve subsequent staining and microscopy of the fixed samples. Though fixation tends to irreversibly terminate any ongoing reactions, thus killing the fixed cells, it makes it possible to obtain information about molecular details that occur too rapidly or transiently to study in living samples. Common fixatives such as formaldehyde work by disabling proteolytic enzymes, coagulating and denaturing macromolecules, creating crosslinks between them, and protecting specimens from decomposition by bacteria and fungi.
<<fixative>> ::
<<flagellate>> :: (of a cell) Having one or more flagella.
<<flagellum>> ::
<<fluorescence in situ hybridization>> (FISH) ::
<<forward genetics>> :: An experimental approach in molecular genetics in which a researcher starts with a specific known phenotype and attempts to determine the genetic basis of that phenotype by any of a variety of laboratory techniques, commonly by inducing random mutations in the organism's genome and then screening for changes in the phenotype of interest. Observed phenotypic changes are assumed to have resulted from the mutation(s) present in the screened sample, which can then be mapped to specific genomic loci and ultimately to one or more specific candidate genes. This methodology contrasts with reverse genetics, in which a specific gene or its gene product is individually manipulated in order to identify the gene's function.
<<forward mutation>>
<<frameshift mutation>> :: A type of mutation in a nucleic acid sequence caused by the insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not divisible by three. Because of the triplet nature by which nucleotides code for amino acids, a mutation of this sort causes a shift in the reading frame of the nucleotide sequence, resulting in the sequence of codons downstream of the mutation site being completely different from the original.
<<freeze-drying>> See /lyophilization/.
<<Functional Genomics Data (FGED) Society>> :: An organization that works with others "to develop standards for biological research data quality, annotation and exchange" as well as software tools that facilitate their use. ^{[20]}
<<G banding>> :: A technique used in cytogenetics to produce a visible karyotype by staining the condensed chromosomes with Giemsa stain.

<<G1>>
<<G2>>
<<gamete>> :: A haploid cell that is the meiotic product of a progenitor germ cell and the final product of the germ line in sexually reproducing multicellular organisms.

A particular gene can have multiple different versions, or alleles, and a single gene can result in a gene product that influences many different phenotypes.
<<gene dosage>> :: The number of copies of a particular gene present in a genome. Gene dosage directly influences the amount of gene product a cell is able to express, though a variety of controls have evolved which tightly regulate gene expression. Changes in gene dosage caused by mutations include copy-number variations.

<<gene expression>> :: The set of processes by which the information encoded in a gene is used in the synthesis of a gene product, such as a protein or non-coding RNA, or otherwise made available to influence one or more phenotypes. Canonically, the first step is transcription, which produces a messenger RNA molecule complementary to the DNA molecule in which the gene is encoded; for protein-coding genes, the second step is translation, in which the messenger RNA is read by the ribosome to produce a protein. The information contained within a DNA sequence need not necessarily be transcribed and translated to exert an influence on molecular events, however; broader definitions encompass a huge variety of other ways in which genetic information can be expressed.
<<Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)>> A database of high-throughput functional genomics and gene expression data derived from experimental chips and next-generation sequencing and managed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. ^{[21]} ^{[22]}

<<gene product>> :: Any of the biochemical material resulting from the expression of a gene, most commonly interpreted as the functional mRNA transcript produced by transcription of the gene or the fully constructed protein produced by translation of the transcript, though non-coding RNA molecules such as transfer RNAs may also be considered gene products. A measurement of the quantity of a given gene product that is detectable in a cell or tissue is sometimes used to infer how active the corresponding gene is.
<<gene regulation>> :: The broad range of mechanisms used by cells to control the activity of their genes, especially to allow, prohibit, increase, or decrease the production or expression of specific gene products, such as RNA or proteins. Gene regulation increases an organism's versatility and adaptability by allowing its cells to express different gene products when required by changes in its environment. In multicellular organisms, the regulation of gene expression also drives cellular differentiation and morphogenesis in the embryo, enabling the creation of a diverse array of cell types from the same genome.
<<gene silencing>> :: Any mechanism of gene regulation which drastically reduces or completely prevents the expression of a particular gene. Gene silencing may occur naturally during either transcription or translation. Laboratory techniques often exploit natural silencing mechanisms to achieve gene knockdown.

<<genetic background>>
<<genetic code>> :: A set of rules by which information encoded within nucleic acids is translated into proteins by living cells. These rules define how sequences of nucleotide triplets called codons specify which amino acid will be added next during protein synthesis.

<<genetic disorder>> :: Any illness, disease, or other health problem directly caused by one or more abnormalities in an organism's genome which are congenital (present at birth) and not acquired later in life. Causes may include a mutation to one or more genes, or a chromosomal abnormality such as an aneuploidy of a particular chromosome. The mutation responsible may occur spontaneously during embryonic development or may be inherited from one or both parents, in which case the genetic disorder is also classified as a hereditary disorder. Though the abnormality itself is present before birth, the actual disease it causes may not develop until much later in life; some genetic disorders do not necessarily guarantee eventual disease but simply increase the risk of developing it.
<<genetic distance>> :: A measure of the genetic divergence between species, populations within a species, or individuals, used especially in phylogenetics to express either the time elapsed since the existence of a common ancestor or the degree of differentiation in the DNA sequences comprising the genomes of each population or individual.
<<genetic engineering>> :: The direct, deliberate manipulation of an organism's genetic material using any of a variety of biotechnology methods, including the insertion or removal of genes, the transfer of genes within and between species, the mutation of existing sequences, and the construction of novel sequences using artificial gene synthesis. Genetic engineering encompasses a broad set of technologies by which the genetic composition of individual cells, tissues, or entire organisms may be altered for various purposes, commonly in order to study the functions and expression of individual genes, to produce hormones, vaccines, and other drugs, and to create genetically modified organisms for use in research and agriculture.
<<genetic marker>> :: A specific, easily identifiable, and usually highly polymorphic gene or other DNA sequence with a known location on a chromosome that can be used to identify the individual or species possessing it.
<<genetic recombination>> :: Any reassortment or exchange of genetic material within an individual organism or between individuals of the same or different species, especially that which creates genetic variation. In the broadest sense, the term encompasses a diverse class of naturally occurring mechanisms by which nucleic acid sequences are copied or physically transferred into different genetic environments, including homologous recombination during meiosis or mitosis or as a normal part of DNA repair; horizontal gene transfer events such as bacterial conjugation, viral transduction, or transformation; or errors in DNA replication or cell division. Artificial recombination is central to many genetic engineering techniques which produce recombinant DNA.
<<genetic redundancy>> :: The redundant encoding of two or more distinct gene products that ultimately perform the same biochemical function. Mutations in one of these genes may have a smaller effect on fitness than might be expected, since the redundant genes often compensate for any loss of function and obviate any gain of function.
<<genetic regulatory network>> (GRN) :: A graph that represents the regulatory complexity of gene expression. The vertices (nodes) are represented by various regulatory elements and gene products while the edges (links) are represented by their interactions. These network structures also represent functional relationships by approximating the rate at which genes are transcribed.

<<genome size>> :: The total amount of DNA contained within one copy of a genome, typically measured by mass (in picograms or daltons) or by the total number of base pairs (in kilobases or megabases). For diploid organisms, genome size is often used interchangeably with C-value.
<<genome-wide association study>> (GWAS) ::
<<genomic DNA>> (gDNA) :: The DNA contained in chromosomes, as opposed to the extrachromosomal DNA contained in separate structures such as plasmids or organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts.
<<genomic imprinting>> :: An epigenetic phenomenon that causes genes to be expressed in a manner dependent upon the particular parent from which the gene was inherited. It occurs when epigenetic marks such as DNA or histone methylation are established or "imprinted" in the germ cells of a parent organism and subsequently maintained through cell divisions in the somatic cells of the organism's progeny; as a result, a gene in the progeny that was inherited from the father may be expressed differently than another copy of the same gene that was inherited from the mother.
<<genomic island>> ::
<<genomics>> :: An interdisciplinary field that studies the structure, function, evolution, mapping, and editing of entire genomes, as opposed to individual genes.
<<genotoxicity>> :: The ability of certain chemical agents to cause damage to genetic material within a living cell (e.g. through single- or double-stranded breaks, crosslinking, or point mutations), which may or may not result in a permanent mutation. Though all mutagens are genotoxic, not all genotoxic compounds are mutagenic.

<<glucogenic amino acid>> :: Any amino acid that can be converted into glucose via gluconeogenesis, as opposed to the ketogenic amino acids, which can be converted into ketone bodies. In humans, 18 of the 20 amino acids are glucogenic; only leucine and lysine are not. Five amino acids ( phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, tryptophan, and tyrosine) are both glucogenic and ketogenic.
<<gluconeogenesis>> (GNG) :: The chain of metabolic reactions that results in the generation of glucose from some non-carbohydrate carbon substrates, including the glucogenic amino acids. It is one of two primary pathways used by most animals to maintain blood sugar levels (the other being glycogenolysis), especially during periods of fasting, starvation, and intense exercise.
<<glucose>> ::
<<glycogen>> ::
<<glycogenolysis>> ::
<<glycolysis>> :: The metabolic pathway in which carbohydrate sugars such as glucose are broken down into simpler molecules, releasing chemical energy which can then be used for various cellular functions. In a series of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions, each molecule of glucose is converted into two molecules of pyruvate, with the free energy liberated in this process simultaneously being used to form high-energy bonds in two molecules of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and two molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

They play a major role in gene regulation and expression.
<<histone core>> The complex of eight histone proteins around which double-stranded DNA wraps within a nucleosome. The canonical histone octamer consists of two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, which pair with each other symmetrically to form a ball-shaped cluster around which DNA winds through interactions with the histones' surface domains, though variant histones may replace their analogues in certain contexts.
<<histone modification>> ::
<<histone variant>>
<<hnRNA>> See /heterogeneous nuclear RNA/.
<<holocentric>> :: (of a linear chromosome or chromosome fragment) Having no single centromere but rather multiple kinetochore assembly sites dispersed along the entire length of the chromosome.

A protein may have one or more homeodomains, generally situated towards the C-terminus of the polypeptide containing it. Many homeodomain-containing proteins function as transcription factors by binding to sequences within promoters and blocking or recruiting other proteins, such as RNA polymerase, to the transcription initiation complex. Homeodomains are the translated versions of homeoboxes, though the terms are often used interchangeably.

It is generally assumed that their expression is unaffected by experimental or pathological conditions.
<<Hox genes>> :: A subset of highly conserved homeobox-containing genes which are essential for the proper organization of the body plan in developing animal embryos, ensuring that the correct structures are formed in the correct places. Hox genes are usually arranged on a chromosome in tandem arrays and are expressed sequentially during development, with the sequence of gene activation corresponding to their physical arrangement within the genome and/or the physical layout of the tissues in which they are expressed along the organism's anterior--posterior axis. ^{[4]}
<<Human Genome Project>> (HGP) :: A collaborative international scientific research project with the goal of sequencing all of the chromosomal DNA and identifying and mapping all of the genes within human cells, and ultimately of assembling a complete reference genome for the human species. The project was launched in 1990 by a consortium of federal agencies, universities, and research institutions and was declared complete in 2003. Because each individual human being has a unique genome, the finished reference genome is a mosaic of sequences obtained by sampling DNA from thousands of individuals across the world and does not represent any one individual.

<<hypotonic>> ::
<<hypoxanthine>> ( I) :: A naturally occurring non-canonical purine nucleobase that is used in some RNA molecules and pairs with standard nucleobases in a phenomenon known as wobble base pairing.

<<initiation codon>> See /start codon/.
<<inosine>> ::
<<insertion>> :: A type of mutation in which one or more bases are added to a nucleic acid sequence. Contrast /deletion/.
<<insertion sequence>> (IS) :: Any nucleotide sequence that is inserted naturally or artificially into another sequence. The term is used in particular to refer to the part of a transposable element that codes for those proteins directly involved in the transposition process, e.g. the transposase enzyme. The coding region in a transposable insertion sequence is usually flanked by short inverted repeats, and the structure of larger transposable elements may include a pair of flanking insertion sequences which are themselves inverted.
<<insertional mutagenesis>> :: The alteration of a DNA sequence by the insertion of one or more nucleotides into the sequence, either naturally or artificially. Depending on the precise location of the insertion within the target sequence, insertions may partially or totally inactivate or even upregulate a gene product or biochemical pathway, or they may be neutral, leading to no substantive changes at all. Many genetic engineering techniques rely on the insertion of exogenous genetic material into host cells in order to study gene function and expression. ^{[4]}
<<insulator>> :: A specific DNA sequence that prevents a gene from being influenced by the activation or repression of nearby genes.
<<integral membrane protein>> (IMP) :: Any of a class of membrane proteins which are permanently embedded within or attached to the cell membrane (as opposed to those which are attached only temporarily). Integral membrane proteins can be subclassified into integral polytopic proteins, which span the entirety of the membrane, and integral monotopic proteins, which adhere only to one side.
<<integral monotopic protein>> :: Any of a class of integral membrane proteins which are permanently attached to one side of the cell membrane by any means but which do not completely span the membrane. Contrast /integral polytopic protein/.
<<integral polytopic protein>> :: Any of a class of integral membrane proteins which span the entirety of the cell membrane, extending from the interior or cytosolic side of the membrane to the exterior or extracellular side. Transmembrane proteins typically have hydrophilic domains exposed to each side as well as one or more hydrophobic domains crossing the nonpolar space inside the lipid bilayer, by which they are further classified as /single-pass/ or /multipass/ membrane proteins. As such many transmembrane proteins function as gated channels or transporters to permit or prohibit the movement of specific molecules or ions across the membrane, often undergoing conformational changes in the process, or as receptors in cell signaling pathways. Contrast /integral monotopic protein/.
<<integration>>
<<integron>> :: A mobile genetic element consisting of a gene cassette containing the gene for a site-specific recombinase, integrase-specific recognition sites, and a promoter that governs the expression of one or more genes conferring adaptive traits on the host cell. Integrons usually exist in the form of circular episomal DNA fragments, through which they facilitate the rapid adaptation of bacteria by enabling horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between different bacterial species. ^{[4]}
<<intein>> :: Any sequence of one or more amino acids within a precursor polypeptide that is excised by protein splicing during post-translational modification and is therefore absent from the mature protein, analogous to the introns spliced out of RNA transcripts. ^{[4]} Contrast /extein/.
<<intercalating agent>> :: Any chemical compound (e.g. ethidium bromide) that disrupts the alignment and pairing of bases in the complementary strands of a DNA molecule by inserting itself between the bases. ^{[2]}

<<interkinesis>> :: The abbreviated pause in activities related to cell division that occurs during meiosis in some species, between the first and second meiotic divisions (i.e. meiosis I and meiosis II). No DNA replication occurs during interkinesis, unlike during the normal interphase that precedes meiosis I and mitosis. ^{[4]}
<<internal ribosome entry site>> (IRES) :: A sequence present in some messenger RNAs that permits recognition by the ribosome and thus the initiation of translation even in the absence of a 5' cap, which in eukaryotes is otherwise required for assembly of the initiation complex. IRES elements are often located in the 5' untranslated region, but may also be found in other positions.
<<interphase>> :: All stages of the cell cycle excluding cell division. A typical cell spends most of its life in interphase, during which it conducts everyday metabolic activities as well as the complete replication of its genome in preparation for mitosis or meiosis.
<<intracellular>> :: Within a cell or cells; i.e. inside the plasma membrane. Contrast /intercellular/ and /extracellular/.
<<intracellular space>> ::
<<intragenic region>> See /intron/.
<<intragenic suppression>>

<<intrinsic membrane protein>> See /integral membrane protein/.
<<intrinsically disordered protein>> (IDP) ::
<<intron>> :: Any nucleotide sequence within a functional gene that is removed by RNA splicing during post-transcriptional modification of the mRNA primary transcript and is therefore absent from the final mature mRNA. The term refers to both the sequence as it exists within a DNA molecule and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. Contrast /exon/.
<<intron intrusion>>
<<intron-mediated recombination>> See /exon shuffling/.
<<invagination>> :: The infolding of a membrane toward the interior of a cell or organelle, or of a sheet of cells toward the interior of a developing embryo, tissue, or organ, forming a distinct membrane-lined pocket. In the case of individual cells, the invaginated pocket may proceed to separate from the source membrane entirely, creating a membrane-bound vesicle within the cell, as in endocytosis. ^{[11]}
<<inverted repeat>> :: A nucleotide sequence followed downstream on the same strand by its own reverse complement. The initial sequence and the reverse complement may be separated by any number of nucleotides, or may be immediately adjacent to each other; in the latter case, the composite sequence is also called a palindromic sequence. Inverted repeats are self-complementary by definition, a property which involves them in many biological functions and dysfunctions. Contrast /direct repeat/.
<<ion channel>> :: A type of transmembrane protein complex which forms an aqueous pore or channel spanning the lipid bilayer of a membrane, through which specific inorganic, electrically charged ions can diffuse down their electrochemical gradients. ^{[6]}
<<ionophore>> :: Any chemical compound or macromolecule that facilitates the movement of ions across biological membranes, or more specifically, any chemical species that reversibly binds electrically charged atoms or molecules. Many ionophores are lipid-soluble proteins that catalyze the transport of monovalent and divalent cations across the hydrophobic lipid bilayers surrounding cells and vesicles. ^{[11]}
<<isochore>> :: A large region of genomic DNA with a relatively homogeneous composition of base pairs, distinguished from other regions by the proportion of pairs that are G- C or A- T. The genomes of most plants and vertebrates are composed of different classes of GC-rich and AT-rich isochores. ^{[4]}
<<isochromosome>> :: A type of abnormal chromosome in which the arms of the chromosome are mirror images of each other. Isochromosome formation is equivalent to simultaneous duplication and deletion events such that two copies of either the long arm or the short arm comprise the resulting chromosome.
<<isomerase>> :: Any of a class of enzymes which catalyze the conversion of a molecule from one isomer to another, such that the product of the reaction has the same molecular formula as the original substrate but differs in the connectivity or spatial arrangement of its atoms.
<<isomeric genes>> Two or more genes that are equivalent and redundant in the sense that, despite coding for distinct gene products, they each result in the same phenotype when set within the same genetic background. If several isomeric genes are present in a single genotype they may be either cumulative or non-cumulative in their contributions to the phenotype. ^{[16]}
<<isotonic>> ::
<<jumping gene>> See /transposable element/.
<<junctional diversity>> ::
<<junk DNA>> Any DNA sequence that appears to have no known biological function, or which acts in a way that has no positive or a net negative effect on the fitness of the genome in which it is located. The term was once more broadly used to refer to all non-coding DNA, though much of this was later discovered to have a function; in modern usage it typically refers to broken or vestigial sequences and selfish genetic elements, including introns, pseudogenes, intergenic DNA, and fragments of transposons and retroviruses, which together constitute a large proportion of the genomes of most eukaryotes. Despite not contributing productively to the host organism, these sequences are able to persist indefinitely inside genomes because the disadvantages of continuing to copy them are too small to be acted upon by natural selection.
<<junk RNA>> Any RNA-encoded sequence, especially a transcript, that appears to have no known biological function, or whose function has no positive or a net negative effect on the fitness of the genome from which it is transcribed. Despite remaining untranslated, many non-coding RNAs still serve important functions, whereas junk RNAs are truly useless: often they are the product of accidental transcription of a junk DNA sequence, or they may result from post-transcriptional processing of primary transcripts, as with spliced-out introns. Junk RNA is usually quickly degraded by ribonucleases and other cytoplasmic enzymes.
<<karyogram>> :: A karyotype which depicts the entire set of chromosomes in a cell or organism by using photomicrographs of the actual chromosomes as they appear /in vivo/ (usually during metaphase, in their most condensed forms), as opposed to the idealized illustrations of chromosomes used in idiograms. The photomicrographs are often still arranged in pairs and by size for easier identification of particular chromosomes, whereas in the actual nucleus there is seldom any apparent organization.
<<karyokinesis>> See /mitosis/.
<<karyolymph>> See /nucleosol/.
<<karyon>> See /nucleus/.
<<karyoplasm>> See /nucleoplasm/.
<<karyopyknosis>> See /pyknosis/.
<<karyorrhexis>> ::
<<karyosome>> ::
<<karyotype>> :: The number and appearance of chromosomes within the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, especially as depicted in an organized karyogram or idiogram (in pairs and arranged by size and by position of the centromere). The term is also used to refer to the complete set of chromosomes in a species or individual organism or to any test that detects this complement or measures the chromosome number.
<<ketogenesis>> ::
<<ketogenic amino acid>> :: Any amino acid that can be converted directly into acetyl-CoA, which can then be oxidized for energy or used as a precursor for many compounds containing ketone groups. This is in contrast to the glucogenic amino acids, which can be converted into glucose. In humans, seven of the 20 amino acids are ketogenic, though only leucine and lysine are exclusively ketogenic; the other five ( phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, tryptophan, and tyrosine) are both ketogenic and glucogenic.
<<ketolysis>> ::
<<kilobase>> (kb) :: A unit of nucleic acid length equal to one thousand (1 ×10 ^{ 3}) bases in single-stranded molecules or one thousand base pairs in duplex molecules such as double-stranded DNA.
<<kinase>> :: Any of a class of enzymes which catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy, phosphate-donating molecules such as ATP to one or more specific substrates, a process known as phosphorylation. The opposite process, known as dephosphorylation, is catalyzed by phosphatase enzymes.
<<kinesis>> :: Any movement or change in activity by a cell or a population of cells in response to a stimulus, such that the rate of the movement or activity is dependent on the intensity of the stimulus but not on the direction from which the stimulus occurs. Kinesis is often defined as any non-specific, non-directional response, in contrast to taxis and tropism.
<<kinetochore>> :: A disc-shaped protein complex which assembles around the centromere of a chromosome during prometaphase of mitosis and meiosis, where it functions as the attachment point for microtubules of the spindle apparatus.
<<knob>> In cytogenetics, an enlarged, heavily staining chromomere that can be used as a visual marker, allowing specific chromosomes to be easily identified in the nucleus. ^{[4]}
<<knockdown>> :: A genetic engineering technique by which the normal rate of expression of one or more of an organism's genes is reduced, either through direct modification of a DNA sequence or through treatment with a reagent such as a short DNA or RNA oligonucleotide with a sequence complementary to either an mRNA transcript or a gene.
<<knockin>> ::
<<knockout>> :: A genetic engineering technique in which an organism is modified to carry genes that have been made inoperative ("knocked out"), such that their expression is disrupted at some point in the pathway that produces their gene products and the organism is deprived of their normal effects. Contrast /knockin/.
<<Kozak consensus sequence>> :: A highly conserved nucleic acid sequence motif which functions as the recognition site for the initiation of translation in most eukaryotic messenger RNAs, generally a sequence of 10 bases immediately surrounding and inclusive of the start codon: GCC RCCAUGG. As the pre-initiation complex scans the transcript, recognition of this sequence (or a close variant) causes the complex to commit to full ribosome assembly and the start of translation. The Kozak sequence is distinct from other recognition sequences relevant to translation such as ribosome binding sites and internal ribosome entry sites. ^{[24]}
<<Krebs cycle>> See /citric acid cycle/.
<<labelling>> :: The chemical attachment of a highly selective substance, known as a /label/, /tag/, or /probe/, to a particular cell, protein, amino acid, or other molecule of interest, either naturally or artificially, /in vivo/ or /in vitro/. Natural labelling is a primary mechanism by which biomolecules specifically identify and interact with other biomolecules; important examples include methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. Labelling is also a common laboratory technique, where the label is typically a reactive derivative of a naturally fluorescent compound (e.g. green fluorescent protein), dye, enzyme, antibody, radioactive molecule, or any other substance that makes its target distinguishable in some way. The labelled targets are thereby rendered distinct from their unlabelled surroundings, allowing them to be easily detected, identified, quantified, or isolated for further study.
<<lagging strand>> :: In DNA replication, the nascent strand for which DNA polymerase's direction of synthesis is away from the replication fork, which necessitates a complex and discontinuous process in contrast to the streamlined, continuous synthesis of the other nascent strand, known as the leading strand, which occurs simultaneously. Because DNA polymerase works only in the 5' to 3' direction, but the lagging strand's overall direction of chain elongation must ultimately be the opposite (i.e. 3' to 5', toward the replication fork), elongation must occur by an indirect mechanism in which a primase enzyme synthesizes short RNA primers complementary to the template DNA, and DNA polymerase then extends the primed segments into short chains of nucleotides known as Okazaki fragments. The RNA primers are then removed and replaced with DNA, and the Okazaki fragments are joined by DNA ligase.
<<lampbrush chromosome>> ::
<<lateral gene transfer (LGT)>> See /horizontal gene transfer/.
<<leader sequence>> :: See /5' untranslated region/.
<<leading strand>> :: In DNA replication, the nascent strand for which both the direction of synthesis by DNA polymerase and the direction of overall chain elongation are toward the replication fork; i.e. both occur in the 5' to 3' direction, resulting in a single, continuous elongation process with few or no interruptions. By contrast, the other nascent strand, known as the lagging strand, is assembled in a discontinuous process involving the ligation of short DNA fragments synthesized in the opposite direction, away from the replication fork. ^{[4]}
<<left splicing junction>> The boundary between the left end (by convention, the 5' end) of an intron and the right ( 3') end of an adjacent exon in a pre-mRNA transcript.
<<leptonema>> :: In meiosis, the first of five substages of prophase I, following interphase and preceding zygonema. During leptonema, the replicated chromosomes condense from diffuse chromatin into long, thin strands that are much more visible within the nucleus.
<<lethal mutation>> Any mutation that results in the premature death of the organism carrying it. Recessive lethal mutations are fatal only to homozygotes, whereas dominant lethals are fatal even in heterozygotes. ^{[4]}
<<leucine zipper>> (ZIP) :: A common structural motif in DNA-binding transcription factors and some other types of proteins, approximately 35 amino acids in length, characterized chiefly by the recurrence of the amino acid leucine every seven residues. When modeled in an idealized alpha-helical conformation, the leucine residues are positioned in such a way that they can interdigitate with the same or similar motifs in an alpha helix belonging to another similar polypeptide, facilitating dimerization and the formation of a complex resembling a zipper. ^{[17]}
<<ligand>> :: In biochemistry, any molecule that binds to or interacts with a specific site on a protein or other biomolecule, usually reversibly via intermolecular forces; ^{[6]} or any substance that forms a complex with a biomolecule as part of a biological process. The binding of specific ligands to DNA or proteins is important in many biochemical pathways; for example, protein--ligand binding may result in the protein undergoing a conformational change which alters its function or affinity for other molecules.
<<ligase>> :: A class of enzymes which catalyze the joining of large molecules such as nucleic acids by forming one or more chemical bonds between them, typically C--C, C--O, C--S, or C--N bonds via condensation reactions. An example is DNA ligase, which catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds between adjacent nucleotides on one or both strands of a DNA molecule, a reaction known as ligation.
<<ligation>> ::
<<linkage>> :: The tendency of DNA sequences which are physically near to each other on the same chromosome to be inherited together during meiosis. Because the physical distance between them is relatively small, the chance that any two nearby parts of a DNA sequence (often loci or genetic markers) will be separated on to different chromatids during chromosomal crossover is statistically very low; such loci are then said to be more /linked/ than loci that are farther apart. Loci that exist on entirely different chromosomes are said to be perfectly /unlinked/. The standard unit for measuring genetic linkage is the centimorgan (cM).
<<linkage disequilibrium>> ::
<<linker DNA>> :: 1.  A short, synthetic DNA duplex containing the recognition sequence for a particular restriction enzyme. ^{[4]} In molecular cloning, linkers are often deliberately included in recombinant molecules in order to make them easily modifiable by permitting cleavage and insertion of foreign sequences at precise locations. A segment of an engineered plasmid containing many such restriction sites is sometimes called a polylinker.
<<linking number>> :: The number of times that the two strands of a circular double-helical DNA molecule cross each other, equivalent to the twisting number (which measures the torsion of the double helix) plus the writhing number (which measures the degree of supercoiling). The linking number of a closed molecule cannot be changed without breaking and rejoining the strands. DNA molecules which are identical except for their linking numbers are known as /topological isomers/. ^{[4]}
<<lipid>> :: Any of a heterogeneous class of organic compounds, including glycerides (fats), waxes, sterols, and some vitamins, united only by their amphipathic or hydrophobic nature and consequently their very low solubility in water. ^{[17]} Some lipids such as phospholipids tend to form lamellar structures or micelles in aqueous environments, where they serve as the primary constituents of biological membranes. Others such as fatty acids can be metabolized for energy, have important functions in energy storage, or serve as signaling molecules. Colloquially, the term "lipids" is sometimes used as a synonym for fats, though fats are more correctly considered a subclass of lipids.
<<lipid bilayer>> :: A lamellar structure composed of numerous amphipathic lipid molecules packed together in two back-to-back sheets or layers, with their hydrophobic fatty acid "tails" directed inward and their hydrophilic "heads" exposed on the outer surface. This is the basic structural motif for all biological membranes, including the plasma membrane surrounding all cells as well as the membranes surrounding organelles and vesicles. Though bilayers are sometimes colloquially described as /phospholipid bilayers/, phospholipids are just one of several classes of membrane lipids which form bilayers; most membranes are actually a fluid, heterogeneous mixture of phospholipids, glycolipids, and cholesterols, interspersed and studded with various other molecules such as integral proteins. ^{[17]}
<<lncRNA>> See /long non-coding RNA/.
<<locus>> :: A specific, fixed position on a chromosome where a particular gene or genetic marker resides.

<<lyonization>> See /X-inactivation/.
<<lysis>> :: The disruption and decomposition of the plasma membrane surrounding a cell, or more generally of any membrane-bound organelle or vesicle, especially by osmotic, enzymatic, or other chemical or mechanical processes which compromise the membrane's integrity and thereby cause the unobstructed interchange of the contents of intracellular and extracellular spaces. Lysis generally implies the complete and irreversible loss of intracellular organization as a result of the release of the cell's internal components and the dilution of the cytosol, and therefore the death of the cell. Such a cell is said to be /lysed/, and a fluid containing the contents of lysed cells (usually including nucleic acids, proteins, and many other organic molecules) is called a /lysate/. Lysis may occur both naturally and artificially, and is a normal part of the cellular life cycle.
<<lysosome>> ::
<<macromolecule>> :: Any very large molecule composed of dozens, hundreds, or thousands of covalently bonded atoms, especially one with biological significance. Many important biomolecules, such as nucleic acids and proteins, are polymers consisting of a repeated series of smaller monomers; others such as lipids and carbohydrates may not be polymeric but are nevertheless large and complex molecules.
<<macronucleus>> :: The larger of the two types of nuclei which occur in pairs in the cells of some ciliated protozoa. Macronuclei are highly polyploid and responsible for directing vegetative reproduction, in contrast to the diploid micronuclei, which have important functions during conjugation. ^{[2]}

<<meiosis>> :: A specialized type of cell division that occurs exclusively in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, during which DNA replication is followed by two consecutive rounds of division to ultimately produce four genetically unique haploid daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the original diploid parent cell. Meiosis only occurs in cells of the sex organs, and serves the purpose of generating haploid gametes such as sperm, eggs, or spores, which are later fused during fertilization. The two meiotic divisions, known as /Meiosis I/ and /Meiosis II/, may also include various genetic recombination events between homologous chromosomes.
<<meiotic spindle>> See /spindle apparatus/.
<<melting>> The denaturation of a double-stranded nucleic acid into two single strands, especially in the context of the polymerase chain reaction.
<<membrane>> :: A supramolecular aggregate of amphipathic lipid molecules which when suspended in a polar solvent tend to arrange themselves into structures which minimize the exposure of their hydrophobic tails by sheltering them within a ball created by their own hydrophilic heads, i.e. a micelle. Sufficiently large aggregates of phospholipids, when immersed in an aqueous environment, commonly occur as double-layered sheets of molecules which can themselves assume approximately spherical shapes, acting as semipermeable barriers surrounding a water-filled interior space. This is the basic layout used for the biological membranes enclosing all cells, vesicles, and membrane-bound organelles.
<<membrane protein>> :: Any protein that is closely associated either transiently or permanently with the lipid bilayer membrane surrounding a cell, organelle, or vesicle. ^{[4]}
<<membrane-bound organelle>> :: An organelle or cellular compartment enclosed by its own dedicated plasma membrane, separating its interior from the rest of the cytoplasm.
<<messenger RNA>> (mRNA) :: Any of a class of single-stranded RNA molecules which function as molecular messengers, carrying sequence information encoded in the DNA genome to the ribosomes where protein synthesis occurs. The primary products of transcription, mRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase, which builds a chain of ribonucleotides that complement the deoxyribonucleotides of a DNA template; in this way, the DNA sequence of a protein-coding gene is effectively preserved in the raw transcript, which is subsequently processed into a mature mRNA by a series of post-transcriptional modifications.
<<metabolism>> :: The complete set of chemical reactions which sustain and account for the basic processes of life in all living cells, ^{[2]} especially those involving: 1) the conversion of energy from food into energy available for cellular activities; 2) the breakdown of food into simpler compounds which can then be used as substrates to build complex biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids; and 3) the degradation and excretion of toxins, byproducts, and other unusable compounds known as metabolic wastes. In a broader sense the term may include /all/ chemical reactions occurring in living organisms, even those which are not strictly necessary for life but instead serve accessory functions. Many specific cellular activities are accomplished by metabolic pathways in which one chemical is ultimately transformed through a stepwise series of reactions into another chemical, with each reaction catalyzed by a specific enzyme. Most metabolic reactions can be subclassified as catabolic or anabolic.
<<metabolite>> :: An intermediate or end product of metabolism, especially degradative metabolism (catabolism); ^{[2]} or any substance produced by or taking part in a metabolic reaction. Metabolites include a huge variety of small molecules generated by cells from various pathways and having various functions, including as inputs to other pathways and reactions, as signaling molecules, and as stimulators, inhibitors, and cofactors of enzymes. Metabolites may result from the degradation and elimination of naturally occurring compounds as well as of pharmaceutical compounds.

<<microfilament>> :: A long, thin, flexible, rod-like structure composed of polymeric strands of proteins, usually actins, that occurs in abundance in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, forming part of the cytoskeleton. Microfilaments comprise the cell's structural framework. They are modified by and interact with numerous other cytoplasmic proteins, playing important roles in cell stability, motility, contractility, and facilitating changes in cell shape, as well as in cytokinesis.
<<micronucleus>> :: The smaller of the two types of nuclei that occur in pairs in the cells of some ciliated protozoa. Whereas the larger macronucleus is polyploid, the micronucleus is diploid and generally transcriptionally inactive except for the purpose of sexual reproduction, where it has important functions during conjugation. ^{[2]}
<<microRNA>> (miRNA) :: A type of small, single-stranded, non-coding RNA molecule that functions in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, particularly RNA silencing, by base-pairing with complementary sequences in mRNA transcripts, which typically results in the cleavage or destabilization of the transcript or inhibits its translation by ribosomes.
<<microsatellite>> :: A type of satellite DNA consisting of a relatively short sequence of tandem repeats, in which certain motifs (ranging in length from one to six or more bases) are repeated, typically 5--50 times. Microsatellites are widespread throughout most organisms' genomes and tend to have higher mutation rates than other regions. They are classified as variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) DNA, along with longer minisatellites.

In the human genome, minisatellites occur at more than 1,000 loci, especially in centromeres and telomeres, and exhibit high mutation rates and high variability between individuals. Like the shorter microsatellites, they are classified as variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) and are a type of satellite DNA.
<<minor groove>> ::

<<miRNA>> See /microRNA/.
<<mismatch>> An incorrect pairing of nucleobases on complementary strands of DNA or RNA; i.e. the presence in one strand of a duplex molecule of a base that is not complementary (by Watson--Crick pairing rules) to the base occupying the corresponding position in the other strand, which prevents normal hydrogen bonding between the bases. For example, a guanine paired with a thymine would be a mismatch, as guanine normally pairs with cytosine. ^{[10]}
<<mismatch repair>> (MMR) ::
<<missense mutation>> :: A type of point mutation which results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid than in the unmutated sequence. Compare /nonsense mutation/.
<<mistranslation>> The insertion of an incorrect amino acid in a growing peptide chain during translation, i.e. the inclusion of any amino acid that is not the one specified by a particular codon in an mRNA transcript. Mistranslation may originate from a mischarged transfer RNA or from a malfunctioning ribosome. ^{[10]}
<<mitochondrial DNA>> (mtDNA) ::
<<mitochondrial fusion>> ::
<<mitochondrion>> ::
<<mitogen>> :: Any substance or stimulus that promotes or induces mitosis, or more generally which causes cells to re-enter the cell cycle. ^{[3]}
<<mitophagy>> :: The selective degradation of mitochondria by means of autophagy; i.e. the mitochondrion initiates its own degradation. Mitophagy is a regular process in healthy populations of cells by which defective or damaged mitochondria are recycled, preventing their accumulation. It may also occur in response to the changing metabolic needs of the cell, e.g. during certain developmental stages.
<<mitosis>> :: In eukaryotic cells, the part of the cell cycle during which the division of the nucleus takes place and replicated chromosomes are separated into two distinct nuclei. Mitosis is generally preceded by the S phase of interphase, when the cell's DNA is replicated, and either occurs simultaneously with or is followed by cytokinesis, when the cytoplasm and plasma membrane are divided into two new daughter cells. Colloquially, the term "mitosis" is often used to refer to the entire process of cell division, not just the division of the nucleus.
<<mitotic index>> (MI) :: The proportion of cells within a sample which are undergoing mitosis at the time of observation, typically expressed as a percentage or as a value between 0 and 1. The number of cells dividing by mitosis at any given time can vary widely depending on organism, tissue, developmental stage, and culture media, among other factors. ^{[2]}
<<mitotic recombination>> :: The abnormal exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during mitosis (as opposed to meiosis, where it occurs normally). Homologous recombination during mitosis is relatively uncommon; in the laboratory, it can be induced by exposing dividing cells to high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as X rays. As in meiosis, it can separate heterozygous alleles and thereby propagate potentially significant changes in zygosity to daughter cells, though unless it occurs very early in development this often has little or no phenotypic effect, since any phenotypic variance shown by mutant lineages arising in terminally differentiated cells is generally masked or compensated for by neighboring wild-type cells. ^{[2]}
<<mitotic rounding>> ::
<<mitotic segregation>>
<<mitotic spindle>> See /spindle apparatus/.
<<mixoploidy>> :: The presence of more than one different ploidy level, i.e. more than one number of sets of chromosomes, in different cells of the same cellular population. ^{[10]}
<<mobile genetic element>> (MGE) :: Any genetic material that can move between different parts of a genome or be transferred from one species or replicon to another within a single generation. The many types of MGEs include transposable elements, bacterial plasmids, bacteriophage elements which integrate into host genomes by viral transduction, and self-splicing introns.
<<mobilome>> :: The entire set of mobile genetic elements within a particular genome, cell, species, or other taxon, including all transposons, plasmids, prophages, and other self-splicing nucleic acid molecules.
<<molecular biology>> ::
<<molecular cloning>> :: Any of various molecular biology methods designed to replicate a particular molecule, usually a DNA sequence, many times inside the cells of a natural host. Commonly, a recombinant DNA fragment containing a gene of interest is ligated into a plasmid vector, which competent bacterial cells are then induced to uptake in a process known as transformation. The bacteria, carrying the recombinant plasmid, are then allowed to proliferate naturally in cell culture, so that each time the bacterial cells divide, the plasmids are replicated along with the rest of the bacterial genome. Any functioning gene of interest will be expressed by the bacterial cells, and thereby its gene products will also be cloned. The plasmids or gene products, which now exist in many copies, may then be extracted from the bacteria and purified. Molecular cloning is a fundamental tool of genetic engineering designed to study gene expression, to amplify a specific gene product, or to generate a selectable phenotype.
<<molecular genetics>> :: A branch of genetics that employs methods and techniques of molecular biology to study the structure and function of genes and gene products at the molecular level. Contrast /classical genetics/.
<<monad>> A haploid set of chromosomes as it exists inside the nucleus of an immature gametic cell such as an ootid or spermatid, i.e. a cell which has completed meiosis but is not yet a mature gamete. ^{[10]}
<<monocentric>> :: (of a linear chromosome or chromosome fragment) Having only one centromere. Contrast /dicentric/ and /holocentric/.
<<monoclonal>> :: Describing cells, proteins, or molecules descended or derived from a single clone (i.e. from the same genome or genetic lineage) or made in response to a single unique compound. Monoclonal antibodies are raised against only one antigen or can only recognize one unique epitope on the same antigen. Similarly, the cells of some tissues and neoplasms may be described as monoclonal if they are all the asexual progeny of one original parent cell. ^{[2]} Contrast /polyclonal/.
<<monokaryotic>> :: (of a cell) Having a single nucleus, as opposed to no nucleus or multiple nuclei.
<<monomer>> ::
<<monoploid>> ::
<<monosaccharide>> :: Any of a class of organic compounds which are the simplest forms of carbohydrates and the most basic structural subunits or monomers from which larger carbohydrate polymers such as disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides are built. With few exceptions, all monosaccharides are variations on the empirical formula (CH ^{}\\
<<monosomy>> :: The abnormal and frequently pathological presence of only one chromosome of a normal diploid pair. It is a type of aneuploidy.
<<Morpholino>> :: A synthetic polymeric molecule connecting short sequences of nucleobases into artificial antisense oligomers, which are used in genetic engineering to knockdown gene expression by pairing with complementary sequences in naturally occurring RNA or DNA molecules, especially mRNA transcripts, thereby blocking access by other biomolecules such as ribosomes and proteins. Morpholino oligomers are not themselves translated, and neither they nor their hybrid duplexes with RNA are attacked by nucleases; also, unlike the negatively charged phosphates of normal nucleic acids, the synthetic backbones of Morpholinos are electrically neutral, making them less likely to interact non-selectively with a host cell's charged proteins. These properties make them useful and reliable tools for artificially generating mutant phenotypes in living cells. ^{[10]}
<<mosaicism>> :: The presence of two or more populations of cells with different genotypes in an individual organism which has developed from a single fertilized egg. A mosaic organism can result from many kinds of genetic phenomena, including nondisjunction of chromosomes, endoreduplication, or mutations in individual stem cell lineages during the early development of the embryo. Mosaicism is similar to but distinct from chimerism.
<<motif>> :: Any distinctive or recurring sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid or of amino acids in a peptide that is or is conjectured to be biologically significant, especially one that is reliably recognized by other biomolecules or which has a three-dimensional structure that permits unique or characteristic chemical interactions such as DNA binding. ^{[10]} In nucleic acids, motifs are often short (three to ten nucleotides in length), highly conserved sequences which act as recognition sites for DNA-binding enzymes or RNAs involved in the regulation of gene expression.
<<motor protein>> :: Any protein which converts chemical energy derived from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates such as ATP and GTP into mechanical work in order to effect its own locomotion, by propelling itself along a filament or through the cytoplasm. ^{[4]}
<<mRNA>> See /messenger RNA/.
<<mtDNA>> See /mitochondrial DNA/.
<<multicellular>> :: Composed of more than one cell. The term is especially used to describe organisms or tissues consisting of many cells descendant from the same original parent cell which work together in an organized way, but may also describe colonies of nominally single-celled organisms such as protists and bacteria which live symbiotically with each other in large groups. Contrast /unicellular/.
<<multinucleate>> :: (of a cell) Having more than one nucleus within a single cell; i.e. having multiple nuclei occupying the same cytoplasm.
<<multiomics>> ::
<<multiple cloning site>> (MCS) ::
<<mutagen>> :: Any physical or chemical agent that changes the genetic material (usually DNA) of an organism and thereby increases the frequency of mutations above natural background levels.
<<mutagenesis>> :: 1.  The process by which the genetic information of an organism is changed, resulting in a mutation. Mutagenesis may occur spontaneously or as a result of exposure to a mutagen.
<<mutant>> :: An organism, gene product, or phenotypic trait resulting from a mutation, of a type that would not be observed naturally in wild-type specimens.
<<mutation>> :: Any permanent change in the nucleotide sequence of a strand of DNA or RNA, or in the amino acid sequence of a peptide. Mutations play a role in both normal and abnormal biological processes; their natural occurrence is integral to the process of evolution. They can result from errors in replication, chemical damage, exposure to high-energy radiation, or manipulations by mobile genetic elements. Repair mechanisms have evolved in many organisms to correct them. By understanding the effect that a mutation has on phenotype, it is possible to establish the function of the gene or sequence in which it occurs.
<<mutator gene>> Any mutant gene or sequence that increases the spontaneous mutation rate of one or more other genes or sequences. Mutators are often transposable elements, or may be mutant housekeeping genes such as those that encode helicases or proteins involved in proofreading. ^{[10]}
<<mutein>> :: A mutant protein, i.e. a protein whose amino acid sequence differs from that of the normal because of a mutation.
<<muton>> The smallest unit of a DNA molecule in which a physical or chemical change can result in a mutation (conventionally a single nucleotide). ^{[10]}
<</n/ orientation>> One of two possible orientations by which a linear DNA fragment can be inserted into a vector, specifically the one in which the gene maps of both fragment and vector have the same orientation. ^{[10]} Contrast /u orientation/.
<<NAD>> See /nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide/.
<<NADP>> See /nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate/.
<<nanoinjection>> ::
<<nascent>> In the process of being synthesized; incomplete; not yet fully processed or mature. The term is commonly used to describe strands of DNA or RNA which are actively undergoing synthesis during replication or transcription, respectively, or sometimes a complete, fully transcribed RNA molecule before any alterations have been made (e.g. polyadenylation or RNA editing), or a peptide chain actively undergoing translation by a ribosome. ^{[10]}
<<ncAA>> See /non-canonical amino acid/.
<<ncDNA>> See /non-coding DNA/.
<<ncRNA>> See /non-coding RNA/.
<<negative (-) sense strand>> See /template strand/.
<<negative control>> A type of gene regulation in which a repressor binds to an operator upstream from the coding region and thereby prevents transcription by RNA polymerase. An inducer is necessary to switch on transcription in positive control. ^{[11]}
<<negative supercoiling>> ::
<<next-generation sequencing (NGS)>> See /massively parallel sequencing/.
<<nick>> :: A break or discontinuity in the phosphate backbone of one strand of a double-stranded DNA molecule, i.e. where a phosphodiester bond is hydrolyzed but no nucleotides are removed; such a molecule is said to be /nicked/. A nick is a single-strand break, where despite the break the DNA molecule is not ultimately broken into multiple fragments, which contrasts with a cut, where both strands are broken. Nicks may be caused by DNA damage or by dedicated nucleases known as nicking enzymes, which nick DNA at random or specific sites. Nicks are frequently placed by the cell as markers identifying target sites for enzyme activity, including in DNA replication, transcription, and mismatch repair, and also to release torsional stress from overwound DNA molecules, making them important in manipulating DNA topology. ^{[11]}
<<nick translation>> ::
<<nickase>> ::
<<nicking enzyme>> ::
<<nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide>> (NAD) ::
<<nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate>> (NADP ^{+}, NADP) ::
<<nitrogenous base>> :: Any organic compound containing a nitrogen atom that has the chemical properties of a base. A set of five particular nitrogenous bases -- adenine ( A), guanine ( G), cytosine ( C), thymine ( T), and uracil ( U) -- are especially relevant to biology because they are components of nucleotides, which in turn are the primary monomers that make up nucleic acids.
<<non-canonical amino acid (ncAA)>> Any amino acid, natural or artificial, that is not one of the 20 or 21 proteinogenic amino acids encoded by the standard genetic code. There are hundreds of such amino acids, many of which have biological functions and are specified by alternative codes or incorporated into proteins accidentally by errors in translation. Many of the best known naturally occurring ncAAs occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways leading to the standard amino acids, while others have been made synthetically in the laboratory. ^{[12]}
<<non-coding DNA>> (ncDNA) :: Any segment of DNA that does not encode a sequence that may ultimately be transcribed and translated into a protein. In most organisms, only a small fraction of the genome consists of protein-coding DNA, though the proportion varies greatly between species. Some non-coding DNA may still be transcribed into functional non-coding RNA (as with transfer RNAs) or may serve important developmental or regulatory purposes; other regions (as with so-called " junk DNA") appear to have no known biological function.
<<non-coding RNA>> (ncRNA) :: Any molecule of RNA that is not ultimately translated into a protein. The DNA sequence from which a functional non-coding RNA is transcribed is often referred to as an "RNA gene". Numerous types of non-coding RNAs essential to normal genome function are produced constitutively, including transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and small interfering RNA (siRNA); other non-coding RNAs (sometimes described as "junk RNA") have no known function and are likely the product of spurious transcription.
<<non-coding strand>> See /template strand/.
<<nondisjunction>> :: The failure of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids to segregate properly during cell division. Nondisjunction results in daughter cells that are aneuploid, containing abnormal numbers of one or more specific chromosomes. It may be caused by any of a variety of factors.
<<non-homologous end joining>> (NHEJ) ::
<<nonrepetitive sequence>> Broadly, any nucleotide sequence or region of a genome that does not contain repeated sequences, or in which repeats do not comprise a majority; or any segment of DNA exhibiting the reassociation kinetics expected of a unique sequence. ^{[10]}
<<nonsense mutation>> :: A type of point mutation which results in a premature stop codon in the transcribed mRNA sequence, thereby causing the premature termination of translation, which results in a truncated, incomplete, and often non-functional protein.
<<nonsense suppressor>> ::
<<nonsynonymous mutation>> :: A type of mutation in which the substitution of one nucleotide base for another results, after transcription and translation, in an amino acid sequence that is different from that produced by the original unmutated gene. Because nonsynonymous mutations always result in a biological change in the organism, they are often subject to strong selection pressure. Contrast /synonymous mutation/.
<<non-transcribed spacer (NTS)>> See /spacer/.
<<northern blotting>> :: A blotting method in molecular biology used to detect RNA in a sample. Compare /Southern blotting/, /western blotting/, and /eastern blotting/.
<<nRNA>> See /nuclear RNA/.
<<N-terminus>> :: The end of a linear chain of amino acids (i.e. a peptide) that is terminated by the free amine group ( --NH ^{}\\
<<nuclear cage>>
<<nuclear DNA>> :: Any DNA molecule contained within the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, most prominently the DNA in chromosomes. It is sometimes used interchangeably with genomic DNA.
<<nuclear envelope>> :: A sub-cellular barrier consisting of two concentric lipid bilayer membranes that surrounds the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. The nuclear envelope is sometimes simply called the "nuclear membrane", though the structure is actually composed of two distinct membranes, an inner membrane and an outer membrane.
<<nuclear equivalence>> :: The principle that the nuclei of essentially all differentiated cells of a mature multicellular organism are genetically identical to each other and to the nucleus of the zygote from which they descended; i.e. they all contain the same genetic information on the same chromosomes, having been replicated from the original zygotic set with extremely high fidelity. Even though all adult somatic cells have the same set of genes, cells can nonetheless differentiate into distinct cell types by expressing different subsets of these genes. Though this principle generally holds true, the reality is slightly more complex, as mutations such as insertions, deletions, duplications, and translocations as well as chimerism, mosaicism, and various types of genetic recombination can all cause different somatic lineages within the same organism to be genetically non-identical.
<<nuclear export signal>> (NES) ::
<<nuclear lamina>> ::
<<nuclear localization signal>> (NLS) :: An amino acid sequence within a protein which serves as a molecular signal marking the protein for transport into the nucleus, typically consisting of one or more short motifs containing positively charged amino acids (especially lysines and arginines) exposed on the mature protein's surface. Though all proteins are translated in the cytoplasm, many whose primary biological activities occur inside the nucleus, e.g. transcription factors, require nuclear localization signals identifiable by molecular chaperones in order to cross the nuclear envelope. Contrast /nuclear export signal/.
<<nuclear membrane>> See /nuclear envelope/.
<<nuclear pore>> :: A complex of membrane proteins that creates an opening in the nuclear envelope through which certain molecules and ions are permitted to pass in order to cross the envelope and thus enter or exit the nucleus (analogous to the channel proteins in the cell membrane). The nuclear envelope typically has thousands of pores, which selectively regulate the exchange of specific materials between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm, including nuclear proteins, which are synthesized in the cytoplasm but function in the nucleus, as well as messenger RNAs, which are transcribed in the nucleus but must be translated in the cytoplasm. ^{[4]} ^{[3]}
<<nuclear protein>> :: Any protein that is naturally found in or localizes to the cell's nucleus (as opposed to the cytoplasm or elsewhere).
<<nuclear RNA (nRNA)>> Any RNA molecule located within a cell's nucleus, whether associated with chromosomes or existing freely in the nucleoplasm, including small nuclear RNA (snRNA), enhancer RNA (eRNA), and all newly transcribed immature RNAs, coding or non-coding, prior to their export to the cytosol (hnRNA).
<<nuclear transfer>> ::
<<nuclear transport>> :: The mechanisms by which molecules cross the nuclear membrane surrounding a cell's nucleus. Though small molecules and ions can cross the membrane freely, the entry and exit of larger molecules is tightly regulated by nuclear pores, so that most macromolecules such as RNAs and proteins require association with transport factors in order to be chaperoned across.
<<nuclease>> :: Any of a class of enzymes capable of cleaving phosphodiester bonds connecting adjacent nucleotides in a nucleic acid molecule (the opposite of a ligase). Nucleases may nick one or cut both strands of a duplex molecule, and may cleave randomly or at specific recognition sequences. They are ubiquitous and imperative for normal cellular function, and are also widely employed in laboratory techniques.
<<nucleic acid>> :: A long, polymeric macromolecule made up of smaller monomers called nucleotides which are chemically linked to one another in a chain. Two specific types of nucleic acid, DNA and RNA, are common to all living organisms, serving to encode the genetic information governing the construction, development, and ordinary processes of all biological systems. This information, contained within the order or sequence of the nucleotides, is translated into proteins, which direct all of the chemical reactions necessary for life.
<<nucleic acid sequence>> :: The precise order of consecutively linked nucleotides in a nucleic acid molecule such as DNA or RNA. Long sequences of nucleotides are the principal means by which biological systems store genetic information, and therefore the accurate replication, transcription, and translation of such sequences is of the utmost importance, lest the information be lost or corrupted. Nucleic acid sequences may be equivalently referred to as sequences of nitrogenous bases, nucleobases, nucleotides, or base pairs, and they correspond directly to sequences of codons and amino acids.
<<nucleobase>> :: Any of the five primary or canonical nitrogenous bases -- adenine ( A), guanine ( G), cytosine ( C), thymine ( T), and uracil ( U) -- that form nucleosides and nucleotides, the latter of which are the fundamental building blocks of nucleic acids. The ability of these bases to form base pairs via hydrogen bonding, as well as their flat, compact three-dimensional profiles, allows them to "stack" one upon another and leads directly to the long-chain structures of DNA and RNA. When writing sequences in shorthand notation, the letter /N/ is often used to represent a nucleotide containing a generic or unidentified nucleobase.
<<nucleoid>> :: An irregularly shaped region within a prokaryotic cell which contains most or all of the cell's genetic material, but is not enclosed by a nuclear membrane as in eukaryotes.
<<nucleolin>> ::
<<nucleolonema>> The central region of the nucleolus, composed of dense, convoluted fibrillar material. ^{[2]}
<<nucleolus>> :: An organelle within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells which is composed of proteins, DNA, and RNA and serves as the site of ribosome synthesis.
<<nucleoplasm>> :: All of the material enclosed within the nucleus of a cell by the nuclear envelope, analogous to the cytoplasm enclosed by the main cell membrane. Like the cytoplasm, the nucleoplasm is composed of a gel-like substance (the nucleosol) in which various organelles, proteins, and other biomolecules are suspended, including nuclear DNA in the form of chromosomes, the nucleolus, nuclear bodies, and free nucleotides.
<<nucleoprotein>> :: Any protein that is chemically bonded to or conjugated with a nucleic acid molecule. Examples include ribosomes, nucleosomes, and many enzymes.
<<nucleosidase>> Any of a class of enzymes which catalyze the decomposition of nucleosides into their component nitrogenous bases and pentose sugars. ^{[10]}
<<nucleoside>> :: An organic molecule composed of a nitrogenous base bonded to a five-carbon sugar (either ribose or deoxyribose). A nucleotide additionally includes one or more phosphate groups.
<<nucleosol>> ::
<<nucleosome>> :: The basic structural subunit of chromatin used in packaging nuclear DNA such as chromosomes, consisting of a core particle of eight histone proteins around which double-stranded DNA is wrapped in a manner akin to thread wound around a spool. The technical definition of a nucleosome includes a segment of DNA about 146 base pairs in length which makes 1.67 left-handed turns as it coils around the histone core, as well as a stretch of linker DNA (generally 38--80 bp) connecting it to an adjacent core particle, though the term is often used to refer to the core particle alone. Long series of nucleosomes are further condensed by association with histone H1 into higher-order structures such as 30-nm fibers and ultimately supercoiled chromatids. Because the histone--DNA interaction limits access to the DNA molecule by other proteins and RNAs, the precise positioning of nucleosomes along the DNA sequence plays a fundamental role in controlling whether or not genes are transcribed and expressed, and hence mechanisms for moving and ejecting nucleosomes have evolved as a means of regulating the expression of particular loci.
<<nucleosome-depleted region (NDR)>> A region of a genome or chromosome in which long segments of DNA are bound by few or no nucleosomes and thus exposed to manipulation by other proteins and molecules, especially implying that the region is transcriptionally active.
<<nucleotide>> :: An organic molecule that serves as the monomer or subunit of nucleic acid polymers, including RNA and DNA. Each nucleotide is composed of three connected functional groups: a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (either ribose or deoxyribose), and a single phosphate group. Though technically distinct, the term "nucleotide" is often used interchangeably with nitrogenous base, nucleobase, and base pair when referring to the sequences that make up nucleic acids. Compare /nucleoside/.
<<nucleotide sequence>> See /nucleic acid sequence/.
<<nucleus>> :: A large spherical or lobular organelle surrounded by a nuclear membrane which functions as the main storage compartment for the genetic material of eukaryotic cells, including the DNA comprising chromosomes, as well as the site of RNA synthesis during transcription. The vast majority of eukaryotic cells have a single nucleus, though some cells may have more than one nucleus, either temporarily or permanently, and in some organisms there exist certain cell types (e.g. mammalian erythrocytes) which lose their nuclei upon reaching maturity, effectively becoming anucleate. The nucleus is one of the defining features of eukaryotes; the cells of prokaryotes such as bacteria lack nuclei entirely. ^{[2]}
<<occluding junction>> ::
<<ochre>> :: One of three stop codons used in the standard genetic code; in RNA, it is specified by the nucleotide triplet UAA. The other two stop codons are named amber and opal.
<<Okazaki fragments>> :: Short sequences of nucleotides which are synthesized discontinuously by DNA polymerase and later linked together by DNA ligase to create the lagging strand during DNA replication. Okazaki fragments are the consequence of the unidirectionality of DNA polymerase, which only works in the 5' to 3' direction.
<<oligogene>> ::
<<oligomer>> :: Any polymeric molecule consisting of a relatively short series of connected monomers or subunits; e.g. an oligonucleotide is a short series of nucleotides.
<<oligonucleotide>> :: A relatively short chain of nucleic acid residues. In the laboratory, oligonucleotides are commonly used as primers or hybridization probes to detect the presence of larger mRNA molecules or assembled into two-dimensional microarrays for high-throughput sequencing analysis.
<<oligosaccharide>> :: A polymeric carbohydrate molecule consisting of a relatively short chain of connected monosaccharides. Oligosaccharides have important functions in processes such as cell signaling and cell adhesion. Longer chains are called polysaccharides.
<<omnipotent suppressor>>
<<oncogene>> :: A gene that has the potential to cause cancer. In tumor cells, such genes are often mutated and/or expressed at abnormally high levels.
<<one gene--one polypeptide>> The hypothesis that there exists a large class of genes in which each particular gene directs the synthesis of one particular polypeptide or protein. ^{[10]} Historically it was thought that all genes and proteins might follow this rule by definition, but it is now known that many or most proteins are composites of different polypeptides and therefore the product of multiple genes, and also that some genes do not encode polypeptides at all but instead produce non-coding RNAs, which are never translated.
<<opal>> :: One of three stop codons used in the standard genetic code; in RNA, it is specified by the nucleotide triplet UGA. The other two stop codons are named amber and ochre.
<<open chromatin>> :: See /euchromatin/.
<<open reading frame>> (ORF) :: The part of a reading frame that has the ability to be translated from DNA or RNA into protein; any continuous stretch of codons that contains a start codon and a stop codon.
<<operator>> :: A regulatory sequence within an operon, typically located between the promoter sequence and the structural genes of the operon, to which an uninhibited repressor protein can bind, thereby physically obstructing RNA polymerase from initiating the transcription of adjacent cistrons. ^{[13]}
<<operon>> :: A functional unit of gene expression consisting of a cluster of adjacent structural genes which are collectively under the control of a single promoter, along with one or more adjacent regulatory sequences such as operators which affect transcription of the structural genes. The set of genes is transcribed together, usually resulting in a single polycistronic messenger RNA molecule, which may then be translated together or undergo splicing to create multiple mRNAs which are translated independently; the result is that the genes contained in the operon are either expressed together or not at all. Regulatory proteins, including repressors, corepressors, and activators, usually bind specifically to the regulatory sequences of a given operon; by some definitions, the genes that code for these regulatory proteins are also considered part of the operon.
<<operon network>>
<<organelle>> :: A spatially distinct compartment or subunit within a cell which has a specific, specialized function. Organelles occur in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In the latter they are often separated from the cytoplasm by being enclosed with their own membrane bilayer (whence the term /membrane-bound organelles/), though organelles may also be functionally specific areas or structures without a surrounding membrane; some cellular structures which exist partially or entirely outside of the cell membrane, such as cilia and flagella, are also referred to as organelles. There are numerous types of organelles with a wide variety of functions, including the various compartments of the endomembrane system (e.g. the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus), mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, endosomes, and vacuoles, among others. Many organelles are unique to particular cell types or species.
<<origin of replication>> (ORI) :: A particular location within a DNA molecule at which DNA replication is initiated. Origins are usually defined by the presence of a particular replicator sequence or by specific chromatin patterns.
<<osmosis>> ::
<<osmotic shock>> ::
<<outron>> :: A sequence near the 5'-end of a primary mRNA transcript that is removed by a special form of splicing during post-transcriptional processing. Outrons are located entirely outside of the transcript's coding sequences, unlike introns.
<<overexpression>> An abnormally high level of gene expression which results in an excessive number of copies of one or more gene products. Overexpression produces a pronounced gene-related phenotype. ^{[14]} ^{[15]}
<<oxidative phosphorylation>> ::
<<oxidative stress>> ::
<<oxygen cascade>> ::
<<p53>> :: A class of regulatory proteins encoded by the /TP53/ gene in vertebrates which bind DNA and regulate gene expression in order to protect the genome from mutation and block progression through the cell cycle if DNA damage does occur. ^{[4]} It is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers, indicating it plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation.
<<pachynema>> :: In meiosis, the third of five substages of prophase I, following zygonema and preceding diplonema. During pachynema, the synaptonemal complex facilitates crossing over between the synapsed homologous chromosomes, and the centrosomes begin to move apart from each other. ^{[10]}
<<palindromic sequence>> :: A nucleic acid sequence of a double-stranded DNA or RNA molecule in which the unidirectional sequence (e.g. 5' to 3') of nucleotides on one strand matches the sequence in the same direction (e.g. 5' to 3') on the complementary strand. In other words, a nucleotide sequence is said to be palindromic if it is equal to its own reverse complement. Palindromic motifs are common in most genomes and are capable of forming hairpins.
<<paracellular transport>> ::
<<paracrine>> ::
<<parent cell>>
<<passenger>> A DNA fragment of interest designed to be spliced into a 'vehicle' such as a plasmid vector and then cloned. ^{[10]}
<<passive transport>> :: The movement of a solute across a membrane by traveling down an electrochemical or concentration gradient, using only the energy stored in the gradient and not any energy from external sources. ^{[3]} Contrast /active transport/.
<<PCR>> See /polymerase chain reaction/.
<<PCR product>> See /amplicon/.
<<peptidase>> See /protease/.
<<peptide>> :: A short chain of amino acid monomers linked by covalent peptide bonds. Peptides are the fundamental building blocks of longer polypeptide chains and hence of proteins.
<<peptide bond>> :: A covalent chemical bond between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of an adjacent amino acid in a peptide chain, formed by a dehydration reaction catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an enzyme within the ribosome, during translation.
<<pericentriolar material>> (PCM) ::
<<perinuclear space>> :: The space between the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope.
<<peripheral membrane protein>> :: Any of a class of membrane proteins which attach only temporarily to the cell membrane, either by penetrating the lipid bilayer or by attaching to other proteins which are permanently embedded within the membrane. ^{[16]} The ability to reversibly interact with membranes has made peripheral membrane proteins important in a wide variety of roles, where they commonly function as regulatory subunits of channel proteins and cell surface receptors. Many protein domains undergo rearrangement, dissociation, or conformational changes when they interact with the membrane, resulting in the activation of their biological activity. ^{[17]} In protein purification, peripheral membrane proteins are typically more water-soluble and much easier to isolate from the membrane than integral membrane proteins.
<<peroxisome>> :: A small membrane-bound organelle found in many eukaryotic cells which specializes in carrying out oxidative reactions with various enzyme peroxidases and catalase, generally to manage reactive oxygen species but also as a participant in various metabolic pathways such as beta-oxidation of fatty acids. ^{[18]}
<<persistence>> 1.  The tendency of a moving cell to continue moving in the same direction as previously; that is, even in isotropic environments, there inevitably still exists an inherent bias by which, from instant to instant, cells are more likely to not change direction than to change direction. Averaged over long periods of time, however, this bias is less obvious and cell movements are better described as a random walk. ^{[3]}

The opposite process is performed by kinases.
<<phosphate>> ::
<<phosphate backbone>> The linear chain of alternating phosphate and sugar compounds that results from the linking of consecutive nucleotides in the same strand of a nucleic acid molecule, and which serves as the structural framework of the nucleic acid. Each individual strand is held together by a repeating series of phosphodiester bonds connecting each phosphate group to the ribose or deoxyribose sugars of two adjacent nucleotides. These bonds are created by ligases and broken by nucleases.
<<phosphodiester bond>> :: A pair of ester bonds linking a phosphate molecule with the two pentose rings of consecutive nucleosides on the same strand of a nucleic acid. Each phosphate forms a covalent bond with the 3' carbon of one pentose and the 5' carbon of the adjacent pentose; the repeated series of such bonds that holds together a long chain of nucleotides in DNA and RNA is known as the phosphate or phosphodiester backbone.
<<phospholipid>> :: Any of a subclass of lipids consisting of a central alcohol (usually glycerol) covalently bonded to three functional groups: a negatively charged phosphate group, and two long fatty acid chains. This arrangement results in a highly amphipathic molecule which in aqueous solutions tends to aggregate with other, similar molecules in a lamellar or micellar conformation with the hydrophilic phosphate "heads" oriented outward, exposing them to the solution, and the hydrophobic fatty acid "tails" oriented inward, minimizing their interactions with water and other polar compounds. Phospholipids are the major structural membrane lipid in almost all biological membranes except the membranes of some plant cells and chloroplasts, where glycolipids dominate instead. ^{[3]}
<<phospholipid bilayer>> See /lipid bilayer/.
<<phosphorylation>> :: The attachment of a phosphate ion, PO ^{3−}\\

<<pitch>>
<<Piwi-interacting RNA>> (piRNA) ::
<<plasma membrane>> See /cell membrane/.
<<plasmid>> :: Any small DNA molecule that is physically separated from the larger body of chromosomal DNA and can replicate independently. Plasmids are most commonly found as small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules in prokaryotes such as bacteria, though they are also sometimes present in archaea and eukaryotes.
<<plasmid partitioning>> The process by which plasmids which have been replicated inside a parent cell are distributed equally between daughter cells during cell division. ^{[3]}
<<plasmid-mediated resistance>> ::
<<plastid>> :: Any of a class of membrane-bound organelles found in the cells of some eukaryotes such as plants and algae which are hypothesized to have evolved from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria; examples include chloroplasts, chromoplasts, and leucoplasts. Plastids retain their own circular chromosomes which replicate independently of the host cell's genome. Many contain photosynthetic pigments which allow them to perform photosynthesis, while others have been retained for their ability to synthesize unique chemical compounds.
<<pleomorphism>> :: 1.  Variability in the size, shape, or staining of cells and/or their nuclei, particularly as observed in histology and cytopathology, where morphological variation is frequently an indicator of a cellular abnormality such as disease or tumor formation.

A class of post-transcriptional modification, polyadenylation serves different purposes in different cell types and organisms. In eukaryotes, the addition of a poly(A) tail is an important step in the processing of a raw transcript into a mature mRNA, ready for export to the cytoplasm where translation occurs; in many bacteria, polyadenylation has the opposite function, instead promoting the RNA's degradation.
<<polyclonal>> :: Describing cells, proteins, or molecules descended or derived from more than one clone (i.e. from more than one genome or genetic lineage) or made in response to more than one unique stimulus. Antibodies are often described as polyclonal if they have been produced or raised against multiple distinct antigens or multiple variants of the same antigen, such that they can recognize more than one unique epitope. ^{[2]} Contrast /monoclonal/.
<<polylinker>> See /multiple cloning site/.
<<polymer>> :: A macromolecule composed of multiple repeating subunits or monomers; a chain or aggregation of many individual molecules of the same compound or class of compound. ^{[2]} The formation of polymers is known as polymerization and generally only occurs when nucleation sites are present and the concentration of monomers is sufficiently high. ^{[3]} Many of the major classes of biomolecules are polymers, including nucleic acids and polypeptides.
<<polymerase>> :: Any of a class of enzymes which catalyze the synthesis of polymeric molecules, especially nucleic acid polymers, typically by encouraging the pairing of free nucleotides to those of an existing complementary template. DNA polymerases and RNA polymerases are essential for DNA replication and transcription, respectively.
<<polymerase chain reaction>> (PCR) :: Any of a wide variety of molecular biology methods involving the rapid production of millions or billions of copies of a specific DNA sequence, allowing scientists to selectively amplify fragments of a very small sample to a quantity large enough to study in detail. In its simplest form, PCR generally involves the incubation of a target DNA sample of known or unknown sequence with a reaction mixture consisting of oligonucleotide primers, a heat-stable DNA polymerase, and free deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), all of which are supplied in excess. This mixture is then alternately heated and cooled to pre-determined temperatures for pre-determined lengths of time according to a specified pattern which is repeated for many cycles, typically in a thermal cycler which automatically controls the required temperature variations. In each cycle, the most basic of which includes a denaturation phase, annealing phase, and elongation phase, the copies synthesized in the previous cycle are used as templates for synthesis in the next cycle, causing a chain reaction that results in the exponential growth of the total number of copies in the reaction mixture. Amplification by PCR has become a standard technique in virtually all molecular biology laboratories.
<<polymerization>> :: The process by which polymers are created from their constituent monomers; a chemical reaction or series of reactions in which monomeric subunits are covalently linked together into a polymeric chain or three-dimensional structure; e.g. the polymerization of a nucleic acid chain by linking consecutive nucleotides, a reaction catalyzed by a polymerase.
<<polymorphism>>
<<polypeptide>> :: A long, continuous, and unbranched polymeric chain of amino acid monomers linked by covalent peptide bonds, typically longer than a peptide. Proteins generally consist of one or more polypeptides folded or arranged in a biologically functional way.
<<polyploid>> :: (of a cell or organism) Having more than two homologous copies of each chromosome; i.e. any ploidy level that is greater than diploid. Polyploidy may occur as a normal condition of chromosomes in certain cells or even entire organisms, or it may result from errors in cell division or mutations causing the duplication of the entire chromosome set.
<<polysaccharide>> :: A linear or branched polymeric chain of carbohydrate monomers ( monosaccharides). Examples include glycogen and cellulose. ^{[4]}
<<polysome>> :: A complex of a messenger RNA molecule and two or more ribosomes which act to translate the mRNA transcript into a polypeptide.
<<polysomy>> :: The condition of a cell or organism having at least one more copy of a particular chromosome than is normal for its ploidy level, e.g. a diploid organism with three copies of a given chromosome is said to show trisomy. Every polysomy is a type of aneuploidy.
<<polytene chromosome>> ::
<<position effect>> :: Any effect on the expression or functionality of a gene or sequence that is a consequence of its location or position within a chromosome or other DNA molecule. A sequence's precise location relative to other sequences and structures tends to strongly influence its activity and other properties, because different loci on the same molecule can have substantially different genetic backgrounds and physical/chemical environments, which may also change over time. For example, the transcription of a gene located very close to a nucleosome, centromere, or telomere is often repressed or entirely prevented because the proteins that make up these structures block access to the DNA by transcription factors, while the same gene is transcribed at a much higher rate when located in euchromatin. Proximity to promoters, enhancers, and other regulatory elements, as well as to regions of frequent transposition by mobile elements, can also directly affect expression; being located near the end of a chromosomal arm or to common crossover points may affect when replication occurs and the likelihood of recombination. Position effects are a major focus of research in the field of epigenetic inheritance.
<<positional cloning>> :: A strategy for identifying and cloning a candidate gene based on knowledge of its locus or position alone and with little or no information about its products or function, in contrast to functional cloning. This method usually begins by comparing the genomes of individuals expressing a phenotype of unknown provenance (often a hereditary disease) and identifying genetic markers shared between them. Regions defined by markers flanking one or more genes of interest are cloned, and the genes located between the markers can then be identified by any of a variety of means, e.g. by sequencing the region and looking for open reading frames, by comparing the sequence and expression patterns of the region in mutant and wild-type individuals, or by testing the ability of the putative gene to rescue a mutant phenotype. ^{[10]}

<<post-transcriptional modification>> ::
<<post-translational modification>> ::
<<potency>> ::
<<precursor cell>> ::
<<Pribnow box>> ::
<<primary transcript>> :: The unprocessed, single-stranded RNA molecule produced by the transcription of a DNA sequence as it exists before post-transcriptional modifications such as alternative splicing convert it into a mature RNA product such as an mRNA, tRNA, or rRNA. A /precursor mRNA/ or /pre-mRNA/, for example, is a type of primary transcript that becomes a mature mRNA ready for translation after processing.
<<primase>> :: Any of a class of enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of short, ~10-base RNA oligonucleotides which by complementing the lagging strand during DNA replication are used as primers by DNA polymerase to initiate the synthesis of Okazaki fragments. ^{[3]}
<<primer>> :: A short, single-stranded oligonucleotide, typically 5--100 bases in length, which "primes" or initiates nucleic acid synthesis by hybridizing to a complementary sequence on a template strand and thereby provides an existing 3'-end from which a polymerase can extend the new strand. Natural systems exclusively use RNA primers to initiate DNA replication and transcription, whereas the /in vitro/ syntheses performed in many laboratory techniques such as PCR often use DNA primers. In modern laboratories, primers are carefully designed, often in "forward" and "reverse" pairs, to complement specific and unique sequences within genomic DNA, with consideration given to their melting and annealing temperatures, and then purchased from commercial suppliers which create oligonucleotides on demand by  /de novo/ synthesis.
<<primer dimer>> (PD) ::
<<primer walking>> ::
<<priming>> The initiation of nucleic acid synthesis by the hybridization or annealing of one or more primers to a complementary sequence within a template strand.
<<probe>> Any reagent used to make a single measurement in a biochemical assay such as a gene expression experiment. Molecules which have a specific affinity for one or more other molecules may be used to probe for the presence of those other molecules in samples of unknown composition. Probes are often labelled or otherwise used as reporters to indicate whether or not a specific chemical reaction is taking place. See also /hybridization probe/.
<<probe-set>> A collection of two or more probes designed to measure a single molecular species, such as a collection of oligonucleotides designed to hybridize to various parts of the mRNA transcripts generated from a single gene.
<<process molecular gene concept>> ::
<<prometaphase>> :: The second stage of cell division in mitosis, following prophase and preceding metaphase, during which the nuclear membrane disintegrates, the chromosomes inside form kinetochores around their centromeres, microtubules emerging from the poles of the mitotic spindle reach the nuclear space and attach to the kinetochores, and motor proteins associated with the microtubules begin to push the chromosomes toward the center of the cell.
<<promoter>> :: A sequence or region of DNA, usually 100--1,000 base pairs long, to which transcription factors bind in order to recruit RNA polymerase to the sequence and initiate the transcription of one or more genes. Promoters are located upstream of the genes they transcribe, near the transcription start site.
<<promotion>> See /upregulation/.
<<prophase>> :: The first stage of cell division in both mitosis and meiosis, occurring after interphase and before prometaphase, during which the DNA of the chromosomes is condensed into chromatin, the nucleolus disintegrates, centrosomes move to opposite ends of the cell, and the mitotic spindle forms.
<<protease>> :: Any of a class of enzymes which catalyze proteolysis, i.e. the decomposition of proteins into smaller polypeptides or individual amino acids, by cleaving peptide bonds via hydrolysis. Proteases are ubiquitous components of numerous biological pathways, and therefore it is often necessary to inhibit them in order for laboratory techniques involving protein activity to be effective.
<<protein>> :: A polymeric macromolecule composed of one or more long chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Proteins are the three-dimensional structures created when these chains fold into specific higher-order arrangements following translation, and it is this folded structure which determines a protein's chemical activity and hence its biological function. Ubiquitous and fundamental in all living organisms, proteins are the primary means by which the activities of life are performed, participating in the vast majority of the biochemical reactions that occur inside and outside of cells. They are often classified according to the type(s) of reaction(s) they facilitate or catalyze, by the chemical substrate(s) they act upon, or by their functional role in cellular activity; e.g. as structural proteins, motor proteins, enzymes, transcription factors, or links within biochemical pathways.
<<protein folding>> ::
<<protein sorting>> ::
<<protein targeting>> ::
<<proteinogenic amino acid>> :: Any of the 20 canonical amino acids which are encoded by the standard genetic code and incorporated into peptides and ultimately proteins during translation. The term may also be inclusive of an additional two amino acids encoded by non-standard codes which can be incorporated by special translation mechanisms.

<<pulsatile secretion>> ::
<<purine>> :: A double-ringed heterocyclic organic compound which, along with pyrimidine, is one of two molecules from which all nitrogenous bases (including the nucleobases used in DNA and RNA) are derived. Adenine ( A) and guanine ( G) are classified as purines. The letter R is sometimes used to indicate a generic purine; e.g. in a nucleotide sequence read, R may be used to indicate that either purine nucleobase, A or G, can be substituted at the indicated position.
<<putative gene>> A specific nucleotide sequence suspected to be a functional gene based on the identification of its open reading frame. The gene is said to be "putative" in the sense that no function has yet been described for its products.
<<pyknosis>> :: The irreversible condensation of chromatin inside the nucleus as the cell undergoes necrosis or apoptosis, resulting in a compact mass which stains strongly and is conspicuous under a microscope. ^{[10]} It is followed by karyorrhexis.
<<pyrimidine>> :: A single-ringed heterocyclic organic compound which, along with purine, is one of two molecules from which all nitrogenous bases (including the nucleobases used in DNA and RNA) are derived. Cytosine ( C), thymine ( T), and uracil ( U) are classified as pyrimidines. The letter Y is sometimes used to indicate a generic pyrimidine; e.g. in a nucleotide sequence read, Y may be used to indicate that either pyrimidine nucleobase -- C, T, or U -- can be substituted at the indicated position.
<<pyrimidine dimer>> :: A type of molecular lesion caused by photochemical damage to DNA or RNA, whereby exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces the formation of covalent bonds between pyrimidine bases occupying adjacent positions in the same polynucleotide strand, which in turn may cause local conformational changes in secondary structure and prevent base pairing with the opposite strand. In DNA, the dimerization reaction occurs between neighboring thymine and cytosine residues ( T− T, C− C, or T− C); it can also occur between cytosine and uracil residues in double-stranded RNA. Pyrimidine dimers are usually quickly corrected by nucleotide excision repair, but uncorrected lesions can inhibit or arrest polymerase activity during transcription or replication.
<<pyruvic acid>> ::
<<quantitative PCR>> (qPCR) ::
<<quiescent culture>> A cell culture in which there is little or no active cell growth or replication but in which the cells nonetheless continue to survive, as observed with some confluent cultures. ^{[2]}
<<random walk>> :: A popular description of the path followed by a locomotive cell or particle when there is no bias in movement, i.e. when the direction of movement at any given instant is not influenced by the direction of movement in the preceding instant. The essential randomness of cell movement in a uniform environment is only apparent over long periods of time, however; in the short term, cells can and do exhibit a tendency to continue moving in the same direction. ^{[3]}
<<rDNA>> 1.  An abbreviation of recombinant DNA.
<<reading frame>> :: A way of dividing the nucleotide sequence in a DNA or RNA molecule into a set of consecutive, non-overlapping triplets, which is how the sequence is interpreted or "read" by proteins and ribosomes during translation. In coding DNA, each triplet is referred to as a codon and corresponds to a particular amino acid to be added to the nascent peptide during translation. In general, only one reading frame (the so-called open reading frame) in a given section of a nucleic acid can be used to make functional proteins, but there are exceptions in a few organisms. A frameshift mutation results in a shift in the normal reading frame and affects all downstream codons.
<<real-time PCR (rtPCR)>> See /quantitative PCR/.
<<reassociation kinetics>> The measurement and manipulation of the rate of reannealing of complementary strands of DNA, generally by heating and denaturing a double-stranded molecule into single strands and then observing their rehybridization at a cooler temperature. Because the base pair G+ C requires more energy to anneal than the base pair A+ T, the rate of reannealing between two strands depends partly on their nucleotide sequence, and it is therefore possible to predict or estimate the sequence of the duplex molecule by the time it takes to fully hybridize. Reassociation kinetics is studied with C _{0}t analysis: fragments reannealing at low C _{0}t values tend to have highly repetitive sequences, while higher C _{0}t values imply more unique sequences. ^{[10]}
<<receptor>> :: A protein which initiates a cellular response to an external stimulus or propagates a molecular signal by binding a specific extracellular ligand, often a dedicated signaling molecule. Numerous types of receptors exist which serve an enormous variety of functions. /Cell-surface receptors/, such as those that bind acetylcholine and insulin, are embedded within the cell membrane with their binding sites exposed to the extracellular space; /intracellular receptors/, including many hormone receptors, are located in the cytoplasm, where they bind ligands that have diffused across the membrane and into the cell. ^{[4]}
<<reciprocal translocation>> :: A type of chromosomal translocation by which there is a reciprocal exchange of chromosome segments between two or more non- homologous chromosomes. When the exchange of material is evenly balanced, reciprocal translocations are usually harmless.
<<recombinant DNA>> (rDNA) :: Any DNA molecule in which laboratory methods of genetic recombination have brought together genetic material from multiple sources, thereby creating a sequence that would not otherwise be found in a naturally occurring genome. Because DNA molecules from all organisms share the same basic chemical structure and properties, DNA sequences from any species, or even sequences created /de novo/ by artificial gene synthesis, may be incorporated into recombinant DNA molecules. Recombinant DNA technology is widely used in genetic engineering.
<<recombinase>> ::
<<recombination>> See /genetic recombination/, /homologous recombination/, and /chromosomal crossover/.

<<recon>> The smallest unit of a DNA molecule capable of undergoing homologous recombination, i.e. a pair of consecutive nucleotides, adjacent to each other in /cis/. ^{[10]}
<<regulon>> :: A group of non-contiguous genes which are regulated as a unit, generally by virtue of having their expression controlled by the same regulatory element or set of elements, e.g. the same repressor or activator. The term is most commonly used with prokaryotes, where a regulon may consist of genes from multiple operons.
<<repeat>> ::
<<repetitive DNA>> A region or fragment of DNA consisting largely or entirely of repeated nucleotide sequences.
<<replacement mutation>> See /nonsynonymous mutation/.

<<replication eye>> :: The eye-shaped structure that forms when a pair of replication forks, each growing away from the origin, separates the strands of the double helix during DNA replication.
<<replication fork>> :: The point at which the paired strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule are separated by helicase during DNA replication, breaking the hydrogen bonds between the complementary strands and thereby forming a structure with two branching single strands of DNA. Once unpaired, these strands serve as templates from which DNA polymerase synthesizes the leading strand and lagging strand. As replication proceeds, helicase moves along the DNA and continues to separate the strands, causing the replication fork to move as well. ^{[3]} A pair of replication forks forms when helicases work in opposite directions from a single origin of replication, creating a replication eye.
<<replication rate>> The speed at which deoxyribonucleotides are incorporated into an elongating chain by DNA polymerases during DNA replication; or more generally the speed at which any chromosome, genome, cell, or organism makes a complete, independently functional copy of itself.

See also /probe/.
<<reporter gene>> ::
<<repression>> See /downregulation/.
<<repressor>> :: A DNA-binding protein that inhibits the expression of one or more genes by binding to the operator and blocking the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter, thus preventing transcription. This process is known as negative gene regulation or repression.
<<rescue>> The restoration of a defective cell or tissue to a healthy or normal condition, ^{[10]} or the reversion or recovery of a mutant gene to its normal functionality, especially in the context of experimental genetics, where an experiment (e.g. a drug, cross, or gene transfer) resulting in such a restoration is said to /rescue/ the normal phenotype.

<<restriction enzyme>> :: An endonuclease or exonuclease enzyme that recognizes and cleaves a nucleic acid molecule into fragments at or near specific recognition sequences known as restriction sites by breaking the phosphodiester bonds of the nucleic acid backbone. Restriction enzymes are naturally occurring in many organisms, but are also routinely used for artificial modification of DNA in laboratory techniques such as restriction cloning.

<<restriction fragment length polymorphism>> (RFLP) ::
<<restriction map>> :: A diagram of known restriction sites within a known DNA sequence, such as a plasmid vector, obtained by systematically exposing the sequence to various restriction enzymes and then comparing the lengths of the resulting fragments, a technique known as /restriction mapping/. See also /gene map/.
<<restriction site>> :: A short, specific sequence of nucleotides (typically 4 to 8 bases in length) that is reliably recognized by a particular restriction enzyme. Because restriction enzymes usually bind as homodimers, restriction sites are generally palindromic sequences spanning both strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule. Restriction endonucleases cleave the phosphate backbone between two nucleotides within the recognized sequence itself, but other types of restriction enzymes make their cuts at one end of the sequence or at a nearby sequence.
<<reverse genetics>> :: An experimental approach in molecular genetics in which a researcher starts with a known gene and attempts to determine its function or its effect on phenotype by any of a variety of laboratory techniques, commonly by deliberately mutating the gene's nucleic acid sequence or by repressing or silencing its expression and then screening the mutated organisms for obvious changes in phenotype. When the gene of interest is the only one in the genome whose expression has been manipulated, any observed phenotypic changes are assumed to be influenced by it. This is the opposite of forward genetics, in which a known phenotype is linked to one or more unknown genes.
<<reverse transcriptase>> (RT) :: An enzyme capable of synthesizing a complementary DNA molecule from an RNA template, a process termed reverse transcription.
<<reverse transcription>> :: The synthesis of a DNA molecule from an RNA template, the opposite of ordinary transcription. This process, mediated by the enzyme reverse transcriptase, is used by many viruses to replicate their genomes, as well as by retrotransposons and in eukaryotic cells.

<<ribonucleic acid>> (RNA) :: A polymeric nucleic acid molecule composed of a series of ribonucleotides which incorporate a set of four nucleobases: adenine ( A), guanine ( G), cytosine ( C), and uracil ( U). Unlike DNA, RNA is more often found as a single strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double strand. Various types of RNA molecules serve in a wide variety of essential biological roles, including coding, decoding, regulating, and expressing genes, as well as functioning as signaling molecules and, in certain viral genomes, as the primary genetic material itself.
<<ribonucleoprotein>> (RNP) :: A nucleoprotein that is a complex of one or more RNA molecules and one or more proteins. Examples include ribosomes and the enzyme ribonuclease P.

Ribonucleotides canonically incorporate any of four nitrogenous bases: adenine ( A), guanine ( G), cytosine ( C), and uracil ( U). Compare /deoxyribonucleotide/.
<<ribonucleotide reductase>> (RNR) :: An enzyme which catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides via the reductive dehydroxylation of ribonucleotides, specifically by removing the 2' hydroxyl group from the ribose ring of ribonucleoside diphosphates (rNDPs). RNR plays a critical role in regulating the overall rate of DNA synthesis such that the ratio of DNA to cell mass is kept constant during cell division and DNA repair.
<<ribose>> :: A monosaccharide sugar which, as D-ribose in its pentose ring form, is one of three primary components of the ribonucleotides from which ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules are built. Ribose differs from its structural analog deoxyribose only at the 2' carbon, where ribose has an attached hydroxyl group that deoxyribose lacks.
<<ribosomal DNA>> (rDNA) :: A DNA sequence that codes for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In many eukaryotic genomes, rDNA occupies large, highly conserved regions of multiple chromosomes and is rich in both genes and repeats.
<<ribosomal RNA>> (rRNA) :: A type of non-coding RNA which is found in and is the primary constituent of ribosomes, binding to ribosomal proteins to form the small and large subunits. It is ribosomal RNA which enables ribosomes to perform protein synthesis by working as a ribozyme that catalyzes the set of reactions comprising translation. Ribosomal RNA is transcribed from the corresponding ribosomal DNA (rDNA), and is the predominant form of RNA found in most cells, effecting the translation of all encoded proteins despite never being translated itself.
<<ribosome>> :: A macromolecular complex made of both RNA and protein which serves as the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes have two subunits, each of which consists of one or more strands of ribosomal RNA bound to various ribosomal proteins: the small subunit, which reads the messages encoded in messenger RNA molecules, and the large subunit, which links amino acids in sequence to form a polypeptide chain. Ribosomes are fundamental and ubiquitous in all cell types and are used by all known forms of life.
<<riboswitch>> :: A regulatory sequence within a messenger RNA transcript that can bind a small effector molecule, preventing or disrupting translation and thereby acting as a switch that regulates the mRNA's expression.
<<ribozyme>> :: An RNA molecule with enzymatic activity, ^{[4]} i.e. one that is capable of catalyzing one or more specific biochemical reactions, similar to protein enzymes. Ribozymes function in numerous capacities, including in ribosomes as part of the large subunit ribosomal RNA.

<<RNA interference>> (RNAi) ::
<<RNA polymerase>> :: Any of a class of polymerase enzymes that synthesize RNA molecules from a DNA template. RNA polymerases are essential for transcription and are found in all living organisms and many viruses. They build long single-stranded polymers called transcripts by adding ribonucleotides one at a time in the 5'-to- 3' direction, relying on the template provided by the complementary strand to transcribe the nucleotide sequence faithfully.
<<RNA splicing>> ::
<<RNA-induced silencing complex>> (RISC) :: A ribonucleoprotein complex which works to silence endogenous and exogenous genes by participating in various RNA interference pathways at the transcriptional and translational levels. RISC can bind both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA fragments and then cleave them or use them as guides to target complementary mRNAs for degradation.
<<RNase>> See /ribonuclease/.
<<Robertsonian translocation>> (ROB) :: A type of chromosomal translocation by which double-strand breaks at or near the centromeres of two acrocentric chromosomes cause a reciprocal exchange of segments that gives rise to one large metacentric chromosome (composed of the long arms) and one extremely small chromosome (composed of the short arms), the latter of which is often subsequently lost from the cell with little effect because it contains very few genes. The resulting karyotype shows one fewer than the expected total number of chromosomes, because two previously distinct chromosomes have essentially fused together. Carriers of Robertsonian translocations are generally not associated with any phenotypic abnormalities, but do have an increased risk of generating meiotically unbalanced gametes.
<<rolling circle replication>> (RCR) ::
<<rough endoplasmic reticulum>> (RER) ::

<<S phase>> :: The phase of the cell cycle during which nuclear DNA is replicated, occurring after the G1 phase and before the G2 phase. ^{[2]}
<<samesense mutation>> See /synonymous mutation/.
<<Sanger sequencing>> :: A method of DNA sequencing based on the /in vitro/ replication of a DNA template sequence, during which fluorochrome-labeled, chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides are randomly incorporated in the elongating strand; the resulting fragments are then sorted by size with electrophoresis, and the particular fluorochrome terminating each of the size-sorted fragments is detected by laser chromatography, thus revealing the sequence of the original DNA template through the order of the fluorochrome labels as one reads from small-sized fragments to large-sized fragments. Though Sanger sequencing has been replaced in some contexts by next-generation methods, it remains widely used for its ability to produce relatively long sequence reads (500+ nucleotides) and its very low error rate.
<<saturation hybridization>> An /in vitro/ nucleic acid hybridization reaction in which one polynucleotide component (either DNA or RNA) is supplied in great excess relative to the other, causing all complementary sequences in the other polynucleotide to pair with the excess sequences and form hybrid duplex molecules. ^{[10]}
<<scaffolding>> ::
<<scRNA>> See /small conditional RNA/.
<<second-generation sequencing>> See /massively parallel sequencing/.
<<selectable marker>> ::
<<selfish genetic element>> :: Any genetic material (e.g. a gene or any other DNA sequence) which can enhance its own replication and/or transmission into subsequent generations at the expense of other genes in the genome, even if doing so has no positive effect or even a net negative effect on the fitness of the genome as a whole. Selfish elements usually work by producing self-acting gene products which repeatedly copy and paste their own coding sequences into other parts of the genome, independently of normal DNA replication (as with transposable elements); by facilitating the uneven swapping of chromosome segments during genetic recombination events (as with unequal crossing over); or by disrupting the normally equal redistribution of replicated material during mitotis or meiosis such that the probability that the selfish element is present in a given daughter cell is greater than the normal 50 percent (as with gene drives).
<<semiconservative replication>> :: The standard mode of DNA replication that occurs in all living cells, in which each of the two parental strands of the original double-stranded DNA molecule are used as template strands, with DNA polymerases replicating each strand separately and simultaneously in antiparallel directions. The result is that each of the two double-stranded daughter molecules is composed of one of the original parental strands and one newly synthesized complementary strand, such that each daughter molecule conserves the precise sequence of information (indeed the very same atoms) from one-half of the original molecule. Contrast /conservative replication/ and /dispersive replication/.
<<sense>> :: A distinction made between the individual strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule in order to easily and specifically identify each strand. The two complementary strands are distinguished as /sense/ and /antisense/ or, equivalently, the /coding strand/ and the /template strand/. It is the antisense/template strand which is actually used as the template for transcription; the sense/coding strand merely resembles the sequence of codons on the RNA transcript, which makes it possible to determine from the DNA sequence alone the expected amino acid sequence of any protein translated from the RNA transcript. Which strand is which is relative only to a particular RNA transcript and not to the entire DNA molecule; that is, either strand can function as the sense/coding or antisense/template strand.
<<sense codon>> :: Any codon that specifies an amino acid, as opposed to a stop codon, which does not specify any particular amino acid but instead signals the end of translation.
<<sequence>> See /nucleic acid sequence/.
<<sequence logo>> :: In bioinformatics, a graphical representation of the conservation of nucleobases or amino acids at each position within a nucleic acid or protein sequence. Sequence logos are created by aligning many sequences and used to depict consensus sequences as well as the degree of variability within the pool of aligned sequences.
<<sequence-tagged site>> (STS) :: Any DNA sequence that occurs exactly once within a particular genome, and whose location and nucleotide sequence are known with confidence.
<<sequencing>> :: The determination of the order or sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid molecule, or of amino acids in a peptide, by any means. Sequences are usually written as a linear string of letters which conveniently summarizes much of the atomic-level structure of the molecule.
<<sex chromosome>> See /allosome/.
<<sex linkage>> ::
<<Shine--Dalgarno sequence>> :: In many prokaryotic messenger RNAs, the consensus sequence AGGAGGU, located 6--8 bases upstream of the translation start codon, which functions as a binding site for the ribosome by complementing a sequence in the ribosomal RNA. ^{[10]}
<<short arm>> In condensed chromosomes where the positioning of the centromere creates two segments or "arms" of unequal length, the shorter of the two arms of a chromatid. Contrast /long arm/.
<<short interspersed nuclear element>> (SINE) ::
<<short tandem repeat (STR)>> See /microsatellite/.
<<shotgun sequencing>> ::
<<signal transduction>> ::
<<silencer>> :: A sequence or region of DNA that can be bound by a repressor, thereby blocking the transcription of a nearby gene.
<<silencing>> ::
<<silent allele>> An allele that does not produce a detectable product. ^{[10]} Compare /null allele/.
<<silent mutation>> :: A type of neutral mutation which does not have an observable effect on the organism's phenotype. Though the term "silent mutation" is often used interchangeably with synonymous mutation, synonymous mutations are not always silent, nor vice versa. Missense mutations which result in a different amino acid but one with similar functionality (e.g. leucine instead of isoleucine) are also often classified as silent, since such mutations usually do not significantly affect protein function.
<<simple sequence repeat (SSR)>> See /microsatellite/.
<<single-nucleotide polymorphism>> (SNP) :: Any substitution of a single nucleotide which occurs at a specific position within a genome and with measurable frequency within a population; for example, at a specific base position in a DNA sequence, the majority of the individuals in a population may have a cytosine ( C), while in a minority of individuals, the same position may be occupied by an adenine ( A). SNPs are usually defined with respect to a "standard" reference genome; an individual human genome differs from the reference human genome at an average of 4 to 5 million positions, most of which consist of SNPs and short indels. See also /polymorphism/.
<<single-strand break>> (SSB) :: The loss of continuity of the phosphate-sugar backbone in one strand of a DNA duplex. ^{[11]} See also /nick/; contrast /double-strand break/.
<<single-stranded>> :: Composed of a single, unpaired nucleic acid molecule, i.e. one linear strand of nucleotides sharing a single phosphodiester backbone, as opposed to a duplex of two such strands joined by base pairing. See also /single-stranded DNA/ and /single-stranded RNA/.
<<single-stranded DNA>> (ssDNA) :: Any DNA molecule that consists of a single nucleotide polymer or strand, as opposed to a pair of complementary strands held together by hydrogen bonds ( double-stranded DNA). In most circumstances, DNA is more stable and more common in double-stranded form, but high temperatures, low concentrations of dissolved salts, and very high or low pH can cause double-stranded molecules to decompose into two single-stranded molecules in a denaturation process known as melting; this reaction is exploited by naturally occurring enzymes such as those involved in DNA replication as well as by laboratory techniques such as polymerase chain reaction.
<<siRNA>> See /small interfering RNA/.
<<sister chromatids>> :: A pair of identical copies ( chromatids) produced as the result of the DNA replication of a chromosome, particularly when both copies are joined together by a common centromere; the pair of sister chromatids is called a /dyad/. The two sister chromatids are ultimately separated from each other into two different cells during mitosis or meiosis.
<<site-directed mutagenesis>> ::
<<small conditional RNA>> (scRNA) :: A class of small RNA molecules engineered so as to change conformation conditionally in response to cognate molecular inputs, often with the goal of controlling signal transduction pathways /in vitro/ or /in vivo/.
<<small interfering RNA>> (siRNA) ::
<<small nuclear RNA>> (snRNA) ::
<<small nucleolar RNA>> (snoRNA) ::
<<small temporal RNA>> (stRNA) :: A subclass of microRNAs, originally described in nematodes, which regulate the timing of developmental events by binding to complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of messenger RNAs and inhibiting their translation. In contrast to siRNAs, which serve similar purposes, stRNAs bind to their target mRNAs after the initiation of translation and without affecting mRNA stability, which makes it possible for the target mRNAs to resume translation at a later time.
<<smooth endoplasmic reticulum>> (SER) ::
<<snoRNA>> See /small nucleolar RNA/.
<<snRNA>> See /small nuclear RNA/.
<<solenoid fiber>>
<<soluble RNA (sRNA)>> See /transfer RNA/.
<<somatic cell>> :: Any biological cell forming the body of an organism, or, in multicellular organisms, any cell other than a gamete, germ cell, or undifferentiated stem cell. Somatic cells are theoretically distinct from cells of the germ line, meaning the mutations they have undergone can never be transmitted to the organism's descendants, though in practice exceptions do exist.
<<somatic cell nuclear transfer>> (SCNT) ::
<<somatic crossover>> See /mitotic recombination/.
<<Southern blotting>> :: A molecular biology method used for detecting a specific sequence in DNA samples. The technique combines separation of DNA fragments by gel electrophoresis, transfer of the DNA to a synthetic membrane, and subsequent identification of target fragments with radio- labeled or fluorescent hybridization probes.
<<spacer>> :: Any sequence or region of non-coding DNA separating neighboring genes, whether transcribed or not. The term is used in particular to refer to the non-coding regions between the many repeated copies of the ribosomal RNA genes. ^{[11]} See also /intergenic region/.
<<spatially-restricted gene expression>> The expression of one or more genes only within a specific anatomical region or tissue, often in response to a paracrine signal. The boundary between the jurisdictions of two spatially restricted genes may generate a sharp phenotypic gradient there, as with striping patterns.
<<spectral karyotype>> (SKY) ::
<<spindle apparatus>> ::
<<spliceosome>> ::
<<splicing>> See /genetic engineering/.
<<split-gene>>
<<sRNA>> See /transfer RNA/.
<<ssDNA>> See /single-stranded DNA/.
<<ssRNA>> See /single-stranded RNA/.
<<stable uncharacterized transcript (SUT)>>
<<standard genetic code>> The genetic code used by the vast majority of living organisms for translating nucleic acid sequences into proteins. In this system, of the 64 possible permutations of three-letter codons that can be made from the four nucleotides, 61 code for one of the 20 amino acids, and the remaining three code for stop signals. For example, the codon CAG codes for the amino acid glutamine and the codon  UAA is a stop codon. The standard genetic code is described as degenerate or redundant because some amino acids can be coded for by more than one different codon.
<<start codon>> :: The first codon translated by a ribosome from a mature messenger RNA transcript, used as a signal to initiate peptide synthesis. In the standard genetic code, the start codon always codes for the same amino acid, methionine, in eukaryotes and for a modified methionine in prokaryotes. The most common start codon is the triplet AUG. Contrast /stop codon/.
<<statistical genetics>> :: A branch of genetics concerned with the development of statistical methods for drawing inferences from genetic data. The theories and methodologies of statistical genetics often support research in quantitative genetics, genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics.
<<stem cell>> :: Any biological cell which has not yet differentiated into a specialized cell type and which can divide through mitosis to produce more stem cells.
<<stem-loop>> ::
<<sticky end>> :: A term used to describe the end of a double-stranded DNA molecule where one strand is longer than the other by one or more nucleobases, creating a single-stranded "overhang" of unpaired bases, in contrast to a so-called " blunt end", where no such overhang exists because the terminal nucleobases on each strand are base-paired with each other. Blunt ends and sticky ends are relevant when ligating multiple DNA molecules, e.g. in restriction cloning, because many restriction enzymes cut DNA in a way that leaves behind terminal overhangs in the digested fragments. These sticky-ended molecules ligate much more readily with other sticky-ended molecules having complementary overhangs, allowing scientists to ensure that specific DNA fragments are ligated together in specific places.
<<stop codon>> :: A codon that signals the termination of protein synthesis during translation of a messenger RNA transcript. In the standard genetic code, three different stop codons are used to dissociate ribosomes from the growing amino acid chain, thereby ending translation: UAG (nicknamed "amber"), UAA ("ochre"), and UGA ("opal"). Contrast /start codon/.
<<strand>> An individual chain of nucleotides comprising a nucleic acid polymer, existing either singly (in which case the nucleic acid molecule is said to be /single-stranded/) or paired in a duplex (in which case it is said to be /double-stranded/).
<<stringency>> The effect of conditions such as temperature and pH upon the degree of complementarity that is required for a hybridization reaction to occur between two single-stranded nucleic acid molecules. In the most stringent conditions, only exact complements can successfully hybridize; as stringency decreases, an increasing number of mismatches can be tolerated by the two hybridizing strands. ^{[13]}
<<stRNA>> See /small temporal RNA/.
<<structural gene>> :: A gene that codes for any protein or RNA product other than a regulatory factor. Structural gene products include enzymes, structural proteins, and certain non-coding RNAs.
<<structural protein>> :: A protein which as its primary function contributes to the mechanical shape and structure of cells, organelles, or tissues (e.g. collagen and actin), as distinguished from proteins which serve some other purpose, such as enzymes. This distinction is not well-defined, however, as many proteins have both structural and non-structural roles. ^{[2]}
<<subcellular localization>> ::
<<submetacentric>> :: (of a linear chromosome or chromosome fragment) Having a centromere positioned close to but not exactly in the middle of the chromosome, resulting in chromatid arms of slightly different lengths. ^{[5]} Compare /metacentric/.
<<substitution>> :: A type of point mutation in which a single nucleotide and its attached nucleobase is replaced by a different nucleotide.
<<substrate>> :: 1.  A chemical compound or molecule upon which a particular enzyme directly acts, often but not necessarily binding the molecule by forming one or more chemical bonds. ^{[2]} See also /ligand/.
<<substratum>> A solid surface to which a cell or organism adheres or by which it is supported, or over which it moves. ^{[3]} See also /substrate/.
<<subunit>> A single unit of a multi-unit compound molecule or molecular aggregate; e.g. a monomer from which a larger polymer is composed (as with nucleotides in nucleic acids), or an individual polypeptide chain in a multi-chain protein, or an entire protein which participates alongside other proteins as part of a protein complex. ^{[2]} ^{[4]}
<<supercoiling>> ::
<<suppression>> See /downregulation/.
<<suspension culture>> ::
<<swivel point>>
<<symporter>> :: Any of a class of transmembrane transporter proteins which facilitate the transport of two or more different molecules across the membrane at the same time and in the same direction; e.g. glucose and sodium ions. Contrast /antiporter/ and /uniporter/.
<<synapsis>> ::
<<synaptonemal complex>> :: A complex of scaffolding proteins that mediates synapsis and homologous recombination between the chromatids of homologous chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis.
<<syncytium>> ::
<<syndesis>> The synapsis of chromosomes during meiosis. ^{[10]}
<<synezis>> The aggregation of chromosomes into a dense knot that adheres to one side of the nucleus, commonly observed during leptonema in certain organisms. ^{[10]}
<<synonymous mutation>> :: A type of mutation in which the substitution of one nucleotide base for another results, after transcription and translation, in an amino acid sequence which is identical to the original unmutated sequence. This is possible because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, which allows different codons to code for the same amino acid. Though synonymous mutations are often considered silent, this is not always the case; a synonymous mutation may affect the efficiency or accuracy of transcription, splicing, translation, or any other process by which genes are expressed, and thus become effectively non-silent. Contrast /nonsynonymous mutation/.
<<synteny>> ::
<<synthesis phase>> See /S phase/.
<<tandem repeat>> :: A pattern within a nucleic acid sequence in which one or more nucleobases are repeated and the repetitions are directly adjacent (i.e. tandem) to each other. An example is ATGACATGACATGAC, in which the sequence ATGAC is repeated three times.
<<TATA box>> :: A highly conserved non-coding DNA sequence containing a consensus of repeating T and A base pairs that is commonly found in promoter regions of genes in archaea and eukaryotes. The TATA box often serves as the site of initiation of transcription or as a binding site for transcription factors.
<<taxis>> ::
<<TCA>> See /citric acid cycle/.
<<telestability>> Structural destabilization of the DNA double helix at a locus that is relatively distant from the site of binding of a DNA-binding protein. ^{[10]}
<<telocentric>> :: (of a linear chromosome or chromosome fragment) Having a centromere positioned at the terminal end of the chromosome (near or within the telomere), resulting in only a single arm. ^{[5]} Compare /acrocentric/.
<<telomere>> :: A region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a linear chromosome which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration and from fusion with other chromosomes. Since each round of replication results in the shortening of the chromosome, telomeres act as disposable buffers which are sacrificed to perpetual truncation instead of nearby genes; telomeres can also be lengthened by the enzyme telomerase.
<<telomeric silencing>> The repression of transcription of genes in regions adjacent to telomeres. Telomeres also appear to reduce the accessibility of subtelomeric chromatin to modification by DNA methyltransferases. ^{[10]}
<<telophase>> :: The final stage of cell division in both mitosis and meiosis, occurring after anaphase and before or simultaneously with cytokinesis, during which a nuclear membrane is synthesized around each set of chromatids, nucleoli are reassembled, and the mitotic spindle is disassembled. Following cytokinesis, the new daughter cells resume interphase.
<<template strand>> :: The strand of a double-stranded DNA molecule which is used as a template for RNA synthesis during transcription. The sequence of the template strand is complementary to the resulting RNA transcript. Contrast /coding strand/; see also /sense/.
<<terminalization>> In cytology, the progressive shift of chiasmata from their original to more distal positions as meiosis proceeds through diplonema and diakinesis. ^{[10]}
<<termination codon>> See /stop codon/.
<<terminator>> :: A DNA sequence or its RNA complement which signals the termination of transcription by triggering processes that ultimately arrest the activity of RNA polymerase or otherwise cause the release of the RNA transcript from the transcriptional complex. Terminator sequences are usually found near the ends of the coding sequences of genes and operons. They generally function after being themselves transcribed into the nascent RNA strand, whereupon the part of the strand containing the sequence either directly interacts with the transcriptional complex or forms a secondary structure such as a hairpin loop which signals the recruitment of enzymes that promote its disassembly. ^{[10]}
<<tetramer>> :: A molecular aggregate consisting of four subunits. ^{[2]} The term is often used to refer to protein complexes composed of four proteins, e.g. haemoglobin, or to individual proteins composed of four polypeptides. Compare /monomer/, /dimer/, and /trimer/.
<<three-prime end>> See /3'-end/.
<<three-prime untranslated region>> See /3' untranslated region/.
<<thymidine>> ( T, dT) :: One of the four standard nucleosides used in DNA molecules, consisting of a thymine base with its N _{9} nitrogen bonded to the C _{1} carbon of a deoxyribose sugar. The prefix /deoxy-/ is commonly omitted, since there are no ribonucleoside analogs of thymidine used in RNA, where it is replaced with uridine instead.
<<thymine>> ( T) :: A pyrimidine nucleobase used as one of the four standard nucleobases in DNA molecules. Thymine forms a base pair with adenine. In RNA, thymine is not used at all, and is instead replaced with uracil.
<<thymine dimer>> See /pyrimidine dimer/.
<<tissue>> ::
<<tissue culture>> ::
<<tissue-specific gene expression>> Gene function and expression which is restricted to a particular tissue or cell type. Tissue-specific expression is usually the result of an enhancer which is activated only in the proper cell type.
<<tonicity>> ::
<<tonoplast>> :: See /vacuole/.
<<topoisomerase>> :: Any of a class of DNA-binding enzymes which catalyze changes in the topological state of a double-stranded DNA molecule by nicking or cutting the sugar-phosphate backbone of one or both strands, relaxing the torsional stress inherent in the double helix and unwinding or untangling the paired strands before re-ligating the nicks. This process is usually necessary prior to replication and transcription. Topoisomerases thereby convert DNA between its relaxed and supercoiled, linked and unlinked, and knotted and unknotted forms without changing the sequence or overall chemical composition, such that the substrate and product molecules are structural isomers, differing only in their shape and their twisting, linking, and/or writhing numbers.
<<totipotency>> ::
<<tracer>> A molecule or a specific atom within a molecule that has been chemically or radioactively labelled so that it can easily be tracked or followed through a biochemical process or located in a cell or tissue. ^{[4]}
<<trailer sequence>> See /3' untranslated region/.
<</trans/>> On the opposite side; across from; acting from a different molecule. Contrast /cis/.
<</trans/-acting>> :: Affecting a gene or sequence on a different nucleic acid molecule or strand. A locus or sequence within a particular DNA molecule such as a chromosome is said to be /trans/-acting if it or its products influence or act upon other sequences located relatively far away or on an entirely different molecule or chromosome. For example, a DNA-binding protein acts "in /trans/" if it binds to or interacts with a sequence located on any strand or molecule different from the one on which it is encoded. Contrast /cis-acting/.
<<transcribed spacer>> A spacer sequence that is transcribed and thus included in the primary ribosomal RNA transcript (as opposed to a non-transcribed spacer) but subsequently excised and discarded during the maturation of functional RNAs of the ribosome. ^{[10]}
<<transcript>> :: A product of transcription; that is, any RNA molecule which has been synthesized by RNA polymerase using a complementary DNA molecule as a template. When transcription is completed, transcripts separate from the DNA and become independent primary transcripts. Particularly in eukaryotes, multiple post-transcriptional modifications are usually necessary for raw transcripts to be converted into stable and persistent molecules, which are then described as /mature/, though not all transcribed RNAs undergo maturation. Many transcripts are accidental, spurious, incomplete, or defective; others are able to perform their functions immediately and without modification, such as certain non-coding RNAs.
<<transcript of unknown function>> (TUF) ::
<<transcriptase>> See /RNA polymerase/.
<<transcription>> :: The first step in the process of gene expression, in which an RNA molecule, known as a transcript, is synthesized by enzymes called RNA polymerases using a gene or other DNA sequence as a template. Transcription is a critical and fundamental process in all living organisms and is necessary in order to make use of the information encoded within a genome. All classes of RNA must be transcribed before they can exert their effects upon a cell, though only messenger RNA (mRNA) must proceed to translation before a functional protein can be produced, whereas the many types of non-coding RNA fulfill their duties without being translated. Transcription is also not always beneficial for a cell: when it occurs at the wrong time or at a functionless locus, or when mobile elements or infectious pathogens utilize the host's transcription machinery, the resulting transcripts (not to mention the waste of valuable energy and resources) are often harmful to the host cell or genome.
<<transcription factor>> (TF) :: Any protein that controls the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA by binding to a specific DNA sequence and promoting or blocking the recruitment of RNA polymerase to nearby genes. Transcription factors can effectively turn "on" and "off" specific genes in order to make sure they are expressed at the right times and in the right places; for this reason, they are a fundamental and ubiquitous mechanism of gene regulation.
<<transcription start site>> (TSS) :: The specific location within a gene at which RNA polymerase begins transcription, defined by the specific nucleotide or codon corresponding to the first ribonucleotide(s) to be assembled in the nascent transcript (which is not necessarily the same as the first codon to be translated). This site is usually considered the beginning of the coding sequence and is the reference point for numbering the individual nucleotides within a gene. Nucleotides upstream of the start site are assigned negative numbers and those downstream are assigned positive numbers, which are used to indicate the positions of nearby sequences or structures relative to the TSS. For example, the binding site for RNA polymerase might be a short sequence immediately upstream of the TSS, from approximately -80 to -5, whereas an intron within the coding region might be defined as the sequence starting at nucleotide +207 and ending at nucleotide +793.
<<transcription unit>> The segment of DNA between the initiation site and the termination site of transcription, containing the coding sequences for one or more genes. All genes within a transcription unit are transcribed together into a single transcript during a single transcription event; the resulting polycistronic RNA may subsequently be cleaved into separate RNAs, or may be translated as a unit and then cleaved into separate polypeptides. ^{[10]}
<<transcriptional bursting>> :: The intermittent nature of transcription and translation mechanisms. Both processes occur in "bursts" or "pulses", with periods of gene activity separated by irregular intervals.
<<transcriptome>> :: The entire set of RNA molecules (often referring to all types of RNA but sometimes exclusively to messenger RNA) that is or can be expressed by a particular genome, cell, population of cells, or species at a particular time or under particular conditions. The transcriptome is distinct from the exome and the translatome.
<<transcriptomics>> ::
<<transductant>> A cell which has undergone transduction and been successfully transduced.
<<transduction>> :: The transfer of genetic material between cells by a virus or viral vector, either naturally or artificially.
<<transfectant>> A cell which has undergone transfection and been successfully transfected.
<<transfection>> :: The deliberate experimental introduction of exogenous nucleic acids into a cell or embryo. In the broadest sense the term may refer to any such transfer and is sometimes used interchangeably with transformation, though some applications restrict the usage of transfection to the introduction of naked or purified non-viral DNA or RNA into cultured eukaryotic cells (especially animal cells) resulting in the subsequent incorporation of the foreign DNA into the host genome or the non-hereditary modification of gene expression by the foreign RNA. As a contrast to both standard non-viral transformation and transduction, transfection has also occasionally been used to refer to the uptake of purified viral nucleic acids by bacteria or plant cells without the aid of a viral vector. ^{[10]}
<<transfer RNA>> (tRNA) :: A special class of RNA molecule, typically 76 to 90 nucleotides in length, that serves as a physical adapter allowing mRNA transcripts to be translated into sequences of amino acids during protein synthesis. Each tRNA contains a specific anticodon triplet corresponding to an amino acid that is covalently attached to the tRNA's opposite end; as translation proceeds, tRNAs are recruited to the ribosome, where each mRNA codon is paired with a tRNA containing the complementary anticodon. Depending on the organism, cells may employ as many as 41 distinct tRNAs with unique anticodons; because of codon degeneracy within the genetic code, several tRNAs containing different anticodons carry the same amino acid.
<<transferase>> ::
<<transfer-messenger RNA>> (tmRNA) :: A type of RNA molecule in some bacteria which has dual tRNA-like and mRNA-like properties, allowing it to simultaneously perform a number of different functions during translation.
<<transformant>> :: A cell or organism which has taken up extracellular DNA by transformation and which can express genes encoded by it.
<<transformation>> ::
<<transgene>> :: Any gene or other segment of genetic material that has been isolated from one organism and then transferred either naturally or by any of a variety of genetic engineering techniques into another organism, especially one of a different species. Transgenes are usually introduced into the second organism's germ line. They are commonly used to study gene function or to confer an advantage not otherwise available in the unaltered organism.
<<transition>> :: A point mutation in which a purine nucleotide is substituted for another purine ( A ↔ G) or a pyrimidine nucleotide is substituted for another pyrimidine ( C ↔ T). Contrast /transversion/.
<<translation>> :: The second step in the process of gene expression, in which the messenger RNA transcript produced during transcription is read by a ribosome to produce a functional protein.
<<translatome>> :: The entire set of messenger RNA molecules that are translated by a particular genome, cell, tissue, or species at a particular time or under particular conditions. Like the transcriptome, it is often used as a proxy for quantifying levels of gene expression, though the transcriptome also includes many RNA molecules that are never translated.
<<translocation>> :: A type of chromosomal abnormality caused by the structural rearrangement of large sections of one or more chromosomes. There are two main types: reciprocal and Robertsonian.
<<transmembrane protein>> See /integral polytopic protein/.
<<transmission genetics>> The branch of genetics that studies the mechanisms involved in the transfer of genes from parents to offspring. ^{[10]}
<<transposable element>> (TE) ::
<<transposase>> :: Any of a class of self-acting enzymes capable of binding to the flanking sequences of the transposable element which encodes them and catalyzing its movement to another part of a genome, typically by an excision/insertion mechanism or a replicative mechanism, in a process known as transposition.
<<transposition>> :: The process by which a nucleic acid sequence known as a transposable element changes its position within a genome, either by excising and re-inserting itself at a different locus (cut-and-paste) or by duplicating itself without moving the element from its original locus (copy-paste). These reactions are catalyzed by an enzyme known as a transposase which is encoded by a gene within the transposable element itself; thus the element's products are self-acting and can autonomously direct their own replication. Transposed sequences may re-insert at random loci or at sequence-specific targets, either on the same DNA molecule or on different molecules.
<</trans/-splicing>> ::
<<transvectant>> A cell which has undergone transvection and been successfully transvected.
<<transvection>> ::
<<transversion>> :: A point mutation in which a purine nucleotide is substituted for a pyrimidine nucleotide, or vice versa (e.g. A ↔ C or A ↔ T). Contrast /transition/.
<<tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)>> See /citric acid cycle/.
<<triglyceride>> :: Any of a class of chemical compounds which are ester derivatives of glycerol, consisting of a glycerol backbone connected to any three fatty acid substituents via ester bonds. Triglycerides are one of three major classes of esters formed by fatty acids in biological systems, along with phospholipids and cholesteryl esters. They are the primary constituent of adipose tissue in vertebrates.
<<trimer>> A molecular aggregate consisting of three subunits. ^{[19]} The term is often used to refer to protein complexes composed of three proteins, e.g. many membrane porins, or to individual proteins composed of three polypeptides. Compare /monomer/, /dimer/, and /tetramer/.
<<trinucleotide repeat>> :: Any sequence in which an individual nucleotide triplet is repeated many times in tandem, whether in a gene or non-coding sequence. At most loci some degree of repetition is normal and harmless, but mutations which cause specific triplets (especially those of the form Cn G) to increase in copy number above the normal range are highly unstable and responsible for a variety of genetic disorders.
<<triplet>> A unit of three successive nucleotides in a DNA or RNA molecule. ^{[10]} A triplet within a coding sequence that codes for a specific amino acid is known as a codon.
<<trisomy>> :: A type of polysomy in which a diploid cell or organism has three copies of a particular chromosome instead of the normal two.
<<tRNA>> See /transfer RNA/.
<<tRNA-ligase>> See /aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/.
<<tropism>> :: The directional growth or movement of a cell or organism in response to a stimulus, e.g. light, heat, the pull of gravity, or the presence of a particular chemical, such that the response is dependent on the direction of the stimulus (as opposed to a non-directional nastic response). /Positive tropism/ is growth or movement toward the stimulus; /negative tropism/ is away from the stimulus. ^{[2]} See also /taxis/ and /kinesis/.
<<turgor pressure>> ::
<<twisting number>>
<<ubiquitin>> ::
<<ubiquitination>> :: The labelling of a biomolecule (often another protein) by covalently attaching a ubiquitin protein to it, thus making it identifiable to molecules capable of recognizing ubiquitin epitopes.
<<umber>> See /opal/.

<<underwinding>> See /negative supercoiling/.
<<unequal crossing over>> ::
<<uniparental inheritance>> ::
<<uniporter>> :: A type of transport protein which catalyzes the movement of a single, specific solute or chemical species across a lipid membrane in either direction. ^{[4]} Contrast /antiporter/ and /symporter/.
<<unique DNA>> A class of DNA sequences determined by C _{0} /t/ analysis to be present only once in the analyzed genome, as opposed to repetitive sequences. Most structural genes and their introns are unique. ^{[10]}
<<unstable mutation>> A mutation with a high frequency of reversion. ^{[10]}
<<untranslated region>> (UTR) :: Any non-coding sequence which is transcribed along with a protein-coding sequence, and thus included within a messenger RNA, but which is not ultimately translated during protein synthesis. A typical mRNA transcript includes two such regions: one immediately upstream of the coding sequence, known as the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR), and one downstream of the coding sequence, known as the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR). These regions are not removed during post-transcriptional processing (unlike introns) and are usually considered distinct from the 5' cap and the 3' polyadenylated tail (both of which are later additions to a primary transcript and not themselves products of transcription). UTRs are a consequence of the fact that transcription usually begins considerably upstream of the start codon of the coding sequence and terminates long after the stop codon has been transcribed, whereas translation is more precise. They often include motifs with regulatory functions.
<<upregulation>> Any process, natural or artificial, which increases the level of gene expression of a certain gene. A gene which is observed to be expressed at relatively high levels (such as by detecting higher levels of its mRNA transcripts) in one sample compared to another sample is said to be /upregulated/. Contrast /downregulation/.
<<upstream>> Towards or closer to the 5'-end of a chain of nucleotides, or the N-terminus of a peptide chain. Contrast /downstream/.
<<upstream activating sequence>> (UAS) ::
<<uracil>> ( U) :: A pyrimidine nucleobase used as one of the four standard nucleobases in RNA molecules. Uracil forms a base pair with adenine. In DNA, uracil is not used at all, and is instead replaced with thymine.
<<uridine>> ( U, Urd) :: One of the four standard nucleosides used in RNA molecules, consisting of a uracil base with its N _{9} nitrogen bonded to the C _{1} carbon of a ribose sugar. In DNA, uridine is replaced with thymidine.
<<vacuole>> :: Any of a class of enclosed, fluid-filled compartments present in many eukaryotic cells as well as bacteria, often large and conspicuous under the microscope and serving any of a huge variety of functions, including acting as a resizable reservoir for the storage of water, metabolic waste, toxins, or foreign material; maintaining cellular homeostasis and hydrostatic pressure; supporting immune functions; housing symbiotic bacteria; and assisting in the degradation and recycling of old cellular components. ^{[2]}
<<variable number tandem repeat>> (VNTR) ::
<<variegation>> :: Variation or irregularity in a particular phenotype, especially a conspicuous visible trait such as color or pigmentation, occurring simultaneously in different parts of the same individual organism due to any of a variety of causes, such as X-inactivation, mitotic recombination, transposable element activity, position effects, or infection by pathogens.
<<variome>> ::
<<vector>> :: Any DNA molecule used as a vehicle to artificially transport foreign genetic material into another cell, where it can be replicated and/or expressed. Vectors are typically engineered recombinant DNA sequences consisting of an insert (often a transgene) and a longer "backbone" sequence containing an origin of replication, a multiple cloning site, and a selectable marker. Vectors are widely used in molecular biology laboratories to isolate, clone, or express the insert in the target cell.
<<vectorization>>
<<vegetal cell>> See /somatic cell/.
<<vesicle>> :: Any membrane-bound space completely enclosed by its own membrane, which is separate though usually derived from other membranes (often the cell membrane) either by budding or by mechanical disruption such as sonication. ^{[3]} The term is applied to many different structures but especially to the small, roughly spherical compartments created during endocytosis and exocytosis, as well as to lysosomes and various other small intracellular or extracellular organelles. ^{[2]}
<<Warburg effect>> ::
<<western blotting>> ::
<<whole genome sequencing>> (WGS) :: The process of determining the entirety or near-entirety of the DNA sequences comprising an organism's genome with a single procedure or experiment, generally inclusive of all chromosomal and extrachromosomal (e.g. mitochondrial) DNA.
<<wild type>> (WT) :: The phenotype of the typical form of a species as it occurs in nature; a product of the standard "normal" allele at a given locus, as opposed to that produced by a non-standard mutant allele.
<<wobble base pairing>> ::
<<writhing number>> ::
<<X chromosome>> :: One of two sex chromosomes present in organisms which use the XY sex-determination system, and the only sex chromosome in the X0 system. The X chromosome is found in both males and females and typically contains much more gene content than its counterpart, the Y chromosome.
<<X-inactivation>> :: The process by which one of the two copies of the X chromosome is silenced by being irreversibly condensed into transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin in the cells of female therian mammals. A form of dosage compensation, X-inactivation prevents females from producing twice as many gene products from genes on the X chromosome as males, who only have one copy of the X chromosome. Which X chromosome is inactivated is randomly determined in the early embryo, making it possible for cell lineages with different inactive Xs to exist in the same organism.
<<X-linked trait>> ::
<<Y chromosome>> :: One of two sex chromosomes present in organisms which use the XY sex-determination system. The Y chromosome is found only in males and is typically much smaller than its counterpart, the X chromosome.
<<Y fork>> See /replication fork/.
<<yeast artificial chromosome>> (YAC) ::
<<Z-DNA>> ::
<<zinc finger>> ::
<<zygonema>> :: In meiosis, the second of five substages of prophase I, following leptonema and preceding pachynema. During zygonema, synapsis occurs, physically binding homologous chromosomes to each other, and the cell's centrosome divides into two daughter centrosomes, each containing a single centriole. ^{[10]}
<<zygosity>> :: The degree to which multiple copies of a gene, chromosome, or genome have the same genetic sequence; e.g. in a diploid organism with two complete copies of its genome (one maternal and one paternal), the degree of similarity of the alleles present in each copy. Individuals carrying two different alleles for a particular gene are said to be /heterozygous/ for that gene; individuals carrying two identical alleles are said to be /homozygous/ for that gene. Zygosity may also be considered collectively for a group of genes, or for the entire set of genes and genetic loci comprising the genome.
<<zygote>> :: A type of eukaryotic cell formed as the direct result of a fertilization event between two gametes. In multicellular organisms, the zygote is the earliest developmental stage.
