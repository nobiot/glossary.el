401(a) Retirement Plan

A performance issue is observed when I try opening a glossary file with
`consult-recent-file'. When a single org file contains 1000+ radio
targets, the `org-update-radio-target-regexp' function requires a lot of
time to process. Org version is 9.6.15, which is before the
implementation of large radio target regexps variable. Turning on
`org-mode` evaluates (org-update-radio-target-regexp), which then takes
time.

A solution for this is to not use the file extension .org so that the
Org won't be activate for these glossary files. I could not find a way to deactivate radio targets.
