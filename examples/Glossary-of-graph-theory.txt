<<Square brackets [ ]>>  /G/[ /S/] is the induced subgraph of a graph G for vertex subset S.
<<Prime symbol '>> The prime symbol is often used to modify notation for graph invariants so that it applies to the line graph instead of the given graph. For instance, /α/( /G/) is the independence number of a graph; /α/′( /G/) is the matching number of the graph, which equals the independence number of its line graph. Similarly, /χ/( /G/) is the chromatic number of a graph; /χ/ ′( /G/) is the chromatic index of the graph, which equals the chromatic number of its line graph.
<<absorbing>> An absorbing set $A$  of a directed graph $G$  is a set of vertices such that for any vertex $v \in G \smallsetminus A$ , there is an edge from $v$  towards a vertex of $A$ .
<<achromatic>> The achromatic number of a graph is the maximum number of colors in a complete coloring. ^{[1]}
<<acyclic>> 1.  A graph is acyclic if it has no cycles. An undirected acyclic graph is the same thing as a forest. An acyclic directed graph, which is a digraph without directed cycles, is often called a directed acyclic graph, especially in computer science. ^{[2]}
<<adjacency matrix>> The adjacency matrix of a graph is a matrix whose rows and columns are both indexed by vertices of the graph, with a one in the cell for row i and column j when vertices i and j are adjacent, and a zero otherwise. ^{[4]}
<<adjacent>> 1.  The relation between two vertices that are both endpoints of the same edge. ^{[2]}
<<α>> For a graph G, /α/( /G/) (using the Greek letter alpha) is its independence number (see independent), and /α/′( /G/) is its matching number (see matching).
<<alternating>> In a graph with a matching, an alternating path is a path whose edges alternate between matched and unmatched edges. An alternating cycle is, similarly, a cycle whose edges alternate between matched and unmatched edges. An augmenting path is an alternating path that starts and ends at unsaturated vertices. A larger matching can be found as the symmetric difference of the matching and the augmenting path; a matching is maximum if and only if it has no augmenting path.
<<antichain>> In a directed acyclic graph, a subset S of vertices that are pairwise incomparable, i.e., for any $x \leq y$  in S, there is no directed path from x to y or from y to x. Inspired by the notion of antichains in partially ordered sets.
<<anti-edge>> Synonym for /non-edge/, a pair of non-adjacent vertices.
<<anti-triangle>> A three-vertex independent set, the complement of a triangle.
<<apex>> 1.  An apex graph is a graph in which one vertex can be removed, leaving a planar subgraph. The removed vertex is called the apex. A k-apex graph is a graph that can be made planar by the removal of k vertices.
<<arborescence>> Synonym for a rooted and directed tree; see tree.
<<arc>> See edge.
<<arrow>> An ordered pair of vertices, such as an edge in a directed graph. An arrow ( /x/, /y/) has a tail /x/, a head /y/, and a direction from /x/ to /y/; /y/ is said to be the direct successor to /x/ and /x/ the direct predecessor to /y/. The arrow ( /y/, /x/) is the inverted arrow of the arrow ( /x/, /y/).
<<articulation point>> :: A vertex in a connected graph whose removal would disconnect the graph.
<<-ary>> A k-ary tree is a rooted tree in which every internal vertex has no more than k children. A 1-ary tree is just a path. A 2-ary tree is also called a binary tree, although that term more properly refers to 2-ary trees in which the children of each node are distinguished as being left or right children (with at most one of each type). A k-ary tree is said to be complete if every internal vertex has exactly k children.
<<augmenting>> A special type of alternating path; see alternating.
<<automorphism>> A graph automorphism is a symmetry of a graph, an isomorphism from the graph to itself.
<<bag>> One of the sets of vertices in a tree decomposition.
<<balanced>> A bipartite or multipartite graph is balanced if each two subsets of its vertex partition have sizes within one of each other.
<<bandwidth>> The bandwidth of a graph G is the minimum, over all orderings of vertices of G, of the length of the longest edge (the number of steps in the ordering between its two endpoints). It is also one less than the size of the maximum clique in a proper interval completion of G, chosen to minimize the clique size.
<<biclique>> Synonym for complete bipartite graph or complete bipartite subgraph; see complete.
<<biconnected>> Usually a synonym for 2-vertex-connected, but sometimes includes /K/ _{2} though it is not 2-connected. See connected; for biconnected components, see component.
<<binding number>> The smallest possible ratio of the number of neighbors of a proper subset of vertices to the size of the subset. ^{[6]}
<<bipartite>> A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that the vertices in one set are not connected to each other, but may be connected to vertices in the other set. Put another way, a bipartite graph is a graph with no odd cycles; equivalently, it is a graph that may be properly colored with two colors. Bipartite graphs are often written /G/ = ( /U/, /V/, /E/) where U and V are the subsets of vertices of each color. However, unless the graph is connected, it may not have a unique 2-coloring.
<<biregular>> A biregular graph is a bipartite graph in which there are only two different vertex degrees, one for each set of the vertex bipartition.
<<block>> 1.  A block of a graph G is a maximal subgraph which is either an isolated vertex, a bridge edge, or a 2-connected subgraph. If a block is 2-connected, every pair of vertices in it belong to a common cycle. Every edge of a graph belongs in exactly one block.
<<bond>> A minimal cut-set: a set of edges whose removal disconnects the graph, for which no proper subset has the same property.
<<book>> 1.  A book, book graph, or triangular book is a complete tripartite graph /K/ _{1,1, /n/}; a collection of n triangles joined at a shared edge.
<<boundary>> 1.   In a graph embedding, a boundary walk is the subgraph containing all incident edges and vertices to a face.
<<bramble>> A bramble is a collection of mutually touching connected subgraphs, where two subgraphs touch if they share a vertex or each includes one endpoint of an edge. The order of a bramble is the smallest size of a set of vertices that has a nonempty intersection with all of the subgraphs. The treewidth of a graph is the maximum order of any of its brambles.
<<branch>> A path of degree-two vertices, ending at vertices whose degree is unequal to two. ^{[7]}
<<branch-decomposition>> A branch-decomposition of G is a hierarchical clustering of the edges of G, represented by an unrooted binary tree with its leaves labeled by the edges of G. The width of a branch-decomposition is the maximum, over edges e of this binary tree, of the number of shared vertices between the subgraphs determined by the edges of G in the two subtrees separated by e. The branchwidth of G is the minimum width of any branch-decomposition of G.
<<branchwidth>> See branch-decomposition.
<<bridge>> 1.  A bridge, isthmus, or cut edge is an edge whose removal would disconnect the graph. A bridgeless graph is one that has no bridges; equivalently, a 2-edge-connected graph.
<<bridgeless>> A bridgeless graph is a graph that has no bridge edges; that is, a 2-edge-connected graph.
<<butterfly>> 1.  The butterfly graph has five vertices and six edges; it is formed by two triangles that share a vertex.
<</C/>>  /C/ _{/n/} is an n-vertex cycle graph; see cycle.
<<cactus>> A cactus graph, cactus tree, cactus, or Husimi tree is a connected graph in which each edge belongs to at most one cycle. Its blocks are cycles or single edges. If, in addition, each vertex belongs to at most two blocks, then it is called a Christmas cactus.
<<cage>> A cage is a regular graph with the smallest possible order for its girth.
<<card>> A graph formed from a given graph by deleting one vertex, especially in the context of the reconstruction conjecture. See also deck, the multiset of all cards of a graph.
<<carving width>> Carving width is a notion of graph width analogous to branchwidth, but using hierarchical clusterings of vertices instead of hierarchical clusterings of edges.
<<caterpillar>> A caterpillar tree or caterpillar is a tree in which the internal nodes induce a path.
<<center>> The center of a graph is the set of vertices of minimum eccentricity.
<<chain>> 1.  Synonym for walk.
<<Cheeger constant>> See expansion.
<<cherry>> A cherry is a path on three vertices. ^{[8]}
<</χ/>>  /χ/( /G/) (using the Greek letter chi) is the chromatic number of G and /χ/ ′( /G/) is its chromatic index; see chromatic and coloring.
<<child>> In a rooted tree, a child of a vertex v is a neighbor of v along an outgoing edge, one that is directed away from the root.
<<chromatic>> Having to do with coloring; see color. Chromatic graph theory is the theory of graph coloring. The chromatic number /χ/( /G/) is the minimum number of colors needed in a proper coloring of G. /χ/ ′( /G/) is the chromatic index of G, the minimum number of colors needed in a proper edge coloring of G.
<<circle>> A circle graph is the intersection graph of chords of a circle.
<<circuit>> A circuit may refer to a closed trail or an element of the cycle space (an Eulerian spanning subgraph). The circuit rank of a graph is the dimension of its cycle space.
<<circumference>> The circumference of a graph is the length of its longest simple cycle. The graph is Hamiltonian if and only if its circumference equals its order.
<<class>> 1.  A class of graphs or family of graphs is a (usually infinite) collection of graphs, often defined as the graphs having some specific property. The word "class" is used rather than "set" because, unless special restrictions are made (such as restricting the vertices to be drawn from a particular set, and defining edges to be sets of two vertices) classes of graphs are usually not sets when formalized using set theory.
<<claw>> A claw is a tree with one internal vertex and three leaves, or equivalently the complete bipartite graph /K/ _{1,3}. A claw-free graph is a graph that does not have an induced subgraph that is a claw.
<<clique>> A clique is a set of mutually adjacent vertices (or the complete subgraph induced by that set). Sometimes a clique is defined as a maximal set of mutually adjacent vertices (or maximal complete subgraph), one that is not part of any larger such set (or subgraph). A k-clique is a clique of order k. The clique number /ω/( /G/) of a graph G is the order of its largest clique. The clique graph of a graph /G/ is the intersection graph of the maximal cliques in /G/. See also biclique, a complete bipartite subgraph.
<<clique tree>> A synonym for a block graph.
<<clique-width>> The clique-width of a graph G is the minimum number of distinct labels needed to construct G by operations that create a labeled vertex, form the disjoint union of two labeled graphs, add an edge connecting all pairs of vertices with given labels, or relabel all vertices with a given label. The graphs of clique-width at most 2 are exactly the cographs.
<<closed>> 1.  A closed neighborhood is one that includes its central vertex; see neighbourhood.
<<closure>> 1.  For the transitive closure of a directed graph, see transitive.
<<co->> This prefix has various meanings usually involving complement graphs. For instance, a cograph is a graph produced by operations that include complementation; a cocoloring is a coloring in which each vertex induces either an independent set (as in proper coloring) or a clique (as in a coloring of the complement).
<<comparability>> An undirected graph is a comparability graph if its vertices are the elements of a partially ordered set and two vertices are adjacent when they are comparable in the partial order. Equivalently, a comparability graph is a graph that has a transitive orientation. Many other classes of graphs can be defined as the comparability graphs of special types of partial order.
<<complement>> The complement graph $\overline{G}$  of a simple graph G is another graph on the same vertex set as G, with an edge for each two vertices that are not adjacent in G.
<<complete>> 1.  A complete graph is one in which every two vertices are adjacent: all edges that could exist are present. A complete graph with n vertices is often denoted /K/ _{/n/}. A complete bipartite graph is one in which every two vertices on opposite sides of the partition of vertices are adjacent. A complete bipartite graph with a vertices on one side of the partition and b vertices on the other side is often denoted /K/ _{/a/, /b/}. The same terminology and notation has also been extended to complete multipartite graphs, graphs in which the vertices are divided into more than two subsets and every pair of vertices in different subsets are adjacent; if the numbers of vertices in the subsets are /a/, /b/, /c/, ... then this graph is denoted /K/ _{/a/, /b/, /c/, ...}.
<<component>> A connected component of a graph is a maximal connected subgraph. The term is also used for maximal subgraphs or subsets of a graph's vertices that have some higher order of connectivity, including biconnected components, triconnected components, and strongly connected components.
<<condensation>> The condensation of a directed graph G is a directed acyclic graph with one vertex for each strongly connected component of G, and an edge connecting pairs of components that contain the two endpoints of at least one edge in G.
<<cone>> A graph that contains a universal vertex.
<<connect>> Cause to be connected.
<<connected>> A connected graph is one in which each pair of vertices forms the endpoints of a path. Higher forms of connectivity include strong connectivity in directed graphs (for each two vertices there are paths from one to the other in both directions), k-vertex-connected graphs (removing fewer than k vertices cannot disconnect the graph), and k-edge-connected graphs (removing fewer than k edges cannot disconnect the graph).
<<connected component>> Synonym for component.
<<converse>> The converse graph is a synonym for the transpose graph; see transpose.
<<core>> 1.  A k-core is the induced subgraph formed by removing all vertices of degree less than k, and all vertices whose degree becomes less than k after earlier removals. See degeneracy.
<<cotree>> 1.  The complement of a spanning tree.
<<cover>> A vertex cover is a set of vertices incident to every edge in a graph. An edge cover is a set of edges incident to every vertex in a graph. A set of subgraphs of a graph covers that graph if its union -- taken vertex-wise and edge-wise -- is equal to the graph.
<<critical>> A critical graph for a given property is a graph that has the property but such that every subgraph formed by deleting a single vertex does not have the property. For instance, a factor-critical graph is one that has a perfect matching (a 1-factor) for every vertex deletion, but (because it has an odd number of vertices) has no perfect matching itself. Compare /hypo-/, used for graphs which do not have a property but for which every one-vertex deletion does.
<<cut point>> See articulation point.
<<cut space>> The cut space of a graph is a GF(2)- vector space having the cut-sets of the graph as its elements and symmetric difference of sets as its vector addition operation.
<<cycle>> 1.  A cycle may be either a kind of graph or a kind of walk. As a walk it may be either be a closed walk (also called a tour) or more usually a closed walk without repeated vertices and consequently edges (also called a simple cycle). In the latter case it is usually regarded as a graph, i.e., the choices of first vertex and direction are usually considered unimportant; that is, cyclic permutations and reversals of the walk produce the same cycle. Important special types of cycle include Hamiltonian cycles, induced cycles, peripheral cycles, and the shortest cycle, which defines the girth of a graph. A k-cycle is a cycle of length k; for instance a 2-cycle is a digon and a 3-cycle is a triangle. A cycle graph is a graph that is itself a simple cycle; a cycle graph with n vertices is commonly denoted /C/ _{/n/}.
<<DAG>> Abbreviation for directed acyclic graph, a directed graph without any directed cycles.
<<deck>> The multiset of graphs formed from a single graph G by deleting a single vertex in all possible ways, especially in the context of the reconstruction conjecture. An edge-deck is formed in the same way by deleting a single edge in all possible ways. The graphs in a deck are also called /cards/. See also critical (graphs that have a property that is not held by any card) and hypo- (graphs that do not have a property that is held by all cards).
<<decomposition>> See tree decomposition, path decomposition, or branch-decomposition.
<<degree>> 1.  The degree of a vertex in a graph is its number of incident edges. ^{[2]} The degree of a graph G (or its maximum degree) is the maximum of the degrees of its vertices, often denoted Δ( /G/); the minimum degree of G is the minimum of its vertex degrees, often denoted /δ/( /G/). Degree is sometimes called /valency/; the degree of v in G may be denoted /d/ _{/G/}( /v/), /d/( /G/), or deg( /v/). The total degree is the sum of the degrees of all vertices; by the handshaking lemma it is an even number. The degree sequence is the collection of degrees of all vertices, in sorted order from largest to smallest. In a directed graph, one may distinguish the in-degree (number of incoming edges) and out-degree (number of outgoing edges). ^{[2]}
<<Δ, /δ/>> Δ( /G/) (using the Greek letter delta) is the maximum degree of a vertex in G, and /δ/( /G/) is the minimum degree; see degree.
<<density>> In a graph of /n/ nodes, the density is the ratio of the number of edges of the graph to the number of edges in a complete graph on /n/ nodes. See dense graph.
<<depth>> The depth of a node in a rooted tree is the number of edges in the path from the root to the node. For instance, the depth of the root is 0 and the depth of any one of its adjacent nodes is 1. It is the level of a node minus one. Note, however, that some authors instead use /depth/ as a synonym for the /level/ of a node. ^{[9]}
<<diameter>> The diameter of a connected graph is the maximum length of a shortest path. That is, it is the maximum of the distances between pairs of vertices in the graph. If the graph has weights on its edges, then its weighted diameter measures path length by the sum of the edge weights along a path, while the unweighted diameter measures path length by the number of edges. For disconnected graphs, definitions vary: the diameter may be defined as infinite, or as the largest diameter of a connected component, or it may be undefined.
<<diamond>> The diamond graph is an undirected graph with four vertices and five edges.
<<diconnected>> Strongly connected. (Not to be confused with disconnected)
<<digon>> A digon is a simple cycle of length two in a directed graph or a multigraph. Digons cannot occur in simple undirected graphs as they require repeating the same edge twice, which violates the definition of simple.
<<digraph>> Synonym for directed graph. ^{[2]}
<<dipath>> See directed path.
<<direct predecessor>> The tail of a directed edge whose head is the given vertex.
<<direct successor>> The head of a directed edge whose tail is the given vertex.
<<directed>> A directed graph is one in which the edges have a distinguished direction, from one vertex to another. ^{[2]} In a mixed graph, a directed edge is again one that has a distinguished direction; directed edges may also be called arcs or arrows.
<<directed arc>> See arrow.
<<directed edge>> See arrow.
<<directed line>> See arrow.
<<directed path>> A path in which all the /edges/ have the same direction. If a directed path leads from vertex /x/ to vertex /y/, /x/ is a predecessor of /y/, /y/ is a successor of /x/, and /y/ is said to be reachable from /x/.
<<direction>> 1.  The asymmetric relation between two adjacent vertices in a graph, represented as an arrow.
<<disconnect>> Cause to be disconnected.
<<disconnected>> Not connected.
<<disjoint>> 1.  Two subgraphs are edge disjoint if they share no edges, and vertex disjoint if they share no vertices.
<<dissociation number>> A subset of vertices in a graph /G/ is called /dissociation/ if it induces a subgraph with maximum degree 1.
<<distance>> The distance between any two vertices in a graph is the length of the shortest path having the two vertices as its endpoints.
<<domatic>> A domatic partition of a graph is a partition of the vertices into dominating sets. The domatic number of the graph is the maximum number of dominating sets in such a partition.
<<dominating>> A dominating set is a set of vertices that includes or is adjacent to every vertex in the graph; not to be confused with a vertex cover, a vertex set that is incident to all edges in the graph. Important special types of dominating sets include independent dominating sets (dominating sets that are also independent sets) and connected dominating sets (dominating sets that induced connected subgraphs). A single-vertex dominating set may also be called a universal vertex. The domination number of a graph is the number of vertices in the smallest dominating set.
<<dual>> A dual graph of a plane graph G is a graph that has a vertex for each face of G.
<</E/>>  /E/( /G/) is the edge set of G; see edge set.
<<ear>> An ear of a graph is a path whose endpoints may coincide but in which otherwise there are no repetitions of vertices or edges.
<<ear decomposition>> An ear decomposition is a partition of the edges of a graph into a sequence of ears, each of whose endpoints (after the first one) belong to a previous ear and each of whose interior points do not belong to any previous ear. An open ear is a simple path (an ear without repeated vertices), and an open ear decomposition is an ear decomposition in which each ear after the first is open; a graph has an open ear decomposition if and only if it is biconnected. An ear is odd if it has an odd number of edges, and an odd ear decomposition is an ear decomposition in which each ear is odd; a graph has an odd ear decomposition if and only if it is factor-critical.
<<eccentricity>> The eccentricity of a vertex is the farthest distance from it to any other vertex.
<<edge>> An edge is (together with vertices) one of the two basic units out of which graphs are constructed. Each edge has two (or in hypergraphs, more) vertices to which it is attached, called its endpoints. Edges may be directed or undirected; undirected edges are also called lines and directed edges are also called arcs or arrows. In an undirected simple graph, an edge may be represented as the set of its vertices, and in a directed simple graph it may be represented as an ordered pair of its vertices. An edge that connects vertices x and y is sometimes written xy.
<<edge cut>> A set of edges whose removal disconnects the graph. A one-edge cut is called a bridge, isthmus, or cut edge.
<<edge set>> The set of edges of a given graph G, sometimes denoted by /E/( /G/).
<<edgeless graph>> The edgeless graph or totally disconnected graph on a given set of vertices is the graph that has no edges. It is sometimes called the empty graph, but this term can also refer to a graph with no vertices.
<<embedding>> A graph embedding is a topological representation of a graph as a subset of a topological space with each vertex represented as a point, each edge represented as a curve having the endpoints of the edge as endpoints of the curve, and no other intersections between vertices or edges. A planar graph is a graph that has such an embedding onto the Euclidean plane, and a toroidal graph is a graph that has such an embedding onto a torus. The genus of a graph is the minimum possible genus of a two-dimensional manifold onto which it can be embedded.
<<empty graph>> 1.  An edgeless graph on a nonempty set of vertices.
<<end>> An end of an infinite graph is an equivalence class of rays, where two rays are equivalent if there is a third ray that includes infinitely many vertices from both of them.
<<endpoint>> One of the two vertices joined by a given edge, or one of the first or last vertex of a walk, trail or path. The first endpoint of a given directed edge is called the /tail/ and the second endpoint is called the /head/.
<<enumeration>> Graph enumeration is the problem of counting the graphs in a given class of graphs, as a function of their order. More generally, enumeration problems can refer either to problems of counting a certain class of combinatorial objects (such as cliques, independent sets, colorings, or spanning trees), or of algorithmically listing all such objects.
<<Eulerian>> An Eulerian path is a walk that uses every edge of a graph exactly once. An Eulerian circuit (also called an Eulerian cycle or an Euler tour) is a closed walk that uses every edge exactly once. An Eulerian graph is a graph that has an Eulerian circuit. For an undirected graph, this means that the graph is connected and every vertex has even degree. For a directed graph, this means that the graph is strongly connected and every vertex has in-degree equal to the out-degree. In some cases, the connectivity requirement is loosened, and a graph meeting only the degree requirements is called Eulerian.
<<even>> Divisible by two; for instance, an even cycle is a cycle whose length is even.
<<expander>> An expander graph is a graph whose edge expansion, vertex expansion, or spectral expansion is bounded away from zero.
<<expansion>> 1.  The edge expansion, isoperimetric number, or Cheeger constant of a graph G is the minimum ratio, over subsets S of at most half of the vertices of G, of the number of edges leaving S to the number of vertices in S.
<<face>> In a plane graph or graph embedding, a connected component of the subset of the plane or surface of the embedding that is disjoint from the graph. For an embedding in the plane, all but one face will be bounded; the one exceptional face that extends to infinity is called the outer face.
<<factor>> A factor of a graph is a spanning subgraph: a subgraph that includes all of the vertices of the graph. The term is primarily used in the context of regular subgraphs: a k-factor is a factor that is k-regular. In particular, a 1-factor is the same thing as a perfect matching. A factor-critical graph is a graph for which deleting any one vertex produces a graph with a 1-factor.
<<factorization>> A graph factorization is a partition of the edges of the graph into factors; a k-factorization is a partition into k-factors. For instance a 1-factorization is an edge coloring with the additional property that each vertex is incident to an edge of each color.
<<family>> A synonym for class.
<<finite>> A graph is finite if it has a finite number of vertices and a finite number of edges. Many sources assume that all graphs are finite without explicitly saying so. A graph is locally finite if each vertex has a finite number of incident edges. An infinite graph is a graph that is not finite: it has infinitely many vertices, infinitely many edges, or both.
<<first order>> The first order logic of graphs is a form of logic in which variables represent vertices of a graph, and there exists a binary predicate to test whether two vertices are adjacent. To be distinguished from second order logic, in which variables can also represent sets of vertices or edges.
<<-flap>> For a set of vertices X, an X-flap is a connected component of the induced subgraph formed by deleting X. The flap terminology is commonly used in the context of /havens/, functions that map small sets of vertices to their flaps. See also the bridge of a cycle, which is either a flap of the cycle vertices or a chord of the cycle.
<<forbidden>> A forbidden graph characterization is a characterization of a family of graphs as being the graphs that do not have certain other graphs as subgraphs, induced subgraphs, or minors. If H is one of the graphs that does not occur as a subgraph, induced subgraph, or minor, then H is said to be forbidden.
<<forcing graph>> A forcing graph is a graph H such that evaluating the subgraph density of H in the graphs of a graph sequence G(n) is sufficient to test whether that sequence is quasi-random.
<<forest>> A forest is an undirected graph without cycles (a disjoint union of unrooted trees), or a directed graph formed as a disjoint union of rooted trees.
<<Frucht>> 1.   Robert Frucht
<<full>> Synonym for induced.
<<functional graph>> A functional graph is a directed graph where every vertex has out-degree one. Equivalently, a functional graph is a maximal directed pseudoforest.
<</G/>> A variable often used to denote a graph.
<<genus>> The genus of a graph is the minimum genus of a surface onto which it can be embedded; see embedding.
<<geodesic>> As a noun, a geodesic is a synonym for a shortest path. When used as an adjective, it means related to shortest paths or shortest path distances.
<<giant>> In the theory of random graphs, a giant component is a connected component that contains a constant fraction of the vertices of the graph. In standard models of random graphs, there is typically at most one giant component.
<<girth>> The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle.
<<graph>> The fundamental object of study in graph theory, a system of vertices connected in pairs by edges. Often subdivided into directed graphs or undirected graphs according to whether the edges have an orientation or not. Mixed graphs include both types of edges.
<<greedy>> Produced by a greedy algorithm. For instance, a greedy coloring of a graph is a coloring produced by considering the vertices in some sequence and assigning each vertex the first available color.
<<Grötzsch>> 1.   Herbert Grötzsch
<<Grundy number>> 1.  The Grundy number of a graph is the maximum number of colors produced by a greedy coloring, with a badly-chosen vertex ordering.
<</H/>> A variable often used to denote a graph, especially when another graph has already been denoted by G.
<</H/-coloring>> An H-coloring of a graph G (where H is also a graph) is a homomorphism from H to G.
<</H/-free>> A graph is H-free if it does not have an induced subgraph isomorphic to H, that is, if H is a forbidden induced subgraph. The H-free graphs are the family of all graphs (or, often, all finite graphs) that are H-free. ^{[10]} For instance the triangle-free graphs are the graphs that do not have a triangle graph as a subgraph. The property of being H-free is always hereditary. A graph is H-minor-free if it does not have a minor isomorphic to H.
<<Hadwiger>> 1.   Hugo Hadwiger
<<Hamiltonian>> A Hamiltonian path or Hamiltonian cycle is a simple spanning path or simple spanning cycle: it covers all of the vertices in the graph exactly once. A graph is Hamiltonian if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle, and traceable if it contains a Hamiltonian path.
<<haven>> A k- haven is a function that maps every set X of fewer than k vertices to one of its flaps, often satisfying additional consistency conditions. The order of a haven is the number k. Havens can be used to characterize the treewidth of finite graphs and the ends and Hadwiger numbers of infinite graphs.
<<height>> 1.  The /height/ of a node in a rooted tree is the number of edges in a longest path, going away from the root (i.e. its nodes have strictly increasing depth), that starts at that node and ends at a leaf.
<<hereditary>> A hereditary property of graphs is a property that is closed under induced subgraphs: if G has a hereditary property, then so must every induced subgraph of G. Compare monotone (closed under all subgraphs) or /minor-closed/ (closed under minors).
<<hexagon>> :: A simple cycle consisting of exactly six edges and six vertices.
<<hole>> A hole is an induced cycle of length four or more. An odd hole is a hole of odd length. An anti-hole is an induced subgraph of order four whose complement is a cycle; equivalently, it is a hole in the complement graph. This terminology is mainly used in the context of perfect graphs, which are characterized by the strong perfect graph theorem as being the graphs with no odd holes or odd anti-holes. The hole-free graphs are the same as the chordal graphs.
<<homomorphic equivalence>> Two graphs are homomorphically equivalent if there exist two homomorphisms, one from each graph to the other graph.
<<homomorphism>> 1.  A graph homomorphism is a mapping from the vertex set of one graph to the vertex set of another graph that maps adjacent vertices to adjacent vertices. This type of mapping between graphs is the one that is most commonly used in category-theoretic approaches to graph theory. A proper graph coloring can equivalently be described as a homomorphism to a complete graph.
<<hyperarc>> A directed hyperedge having a source and target set.
<<hyperedge>> An edge in a hypergraph, having any number of endpoints, in contrast to the requirement that edges of graphs have exactly two endpoints.
<<hypercube>> A hypercube graph is a graph formed from the vertices and edges of a geometric hypercube.
<<hypergraph>> A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which each edge (called a hyperedge in this context) may have more than two endpoints.
<<hypo->> This prefix, in combination with a graph property, indicates a graph that does not have the property but such that every subgraph formed by deleting a single vertex does have the property. For instance, a hypohamiltonian graph is one that does not have a Hamiltonian cycle, but for which every one-vertex deletion produces a Hamiltonian subgraph. Compare critical, used for graphs which have a property but for which every one-vertex deletion does not. ^{[11]}

The terms /vertex-labeled/ or /edge-labeled/ may be used to specify which objects of a graph have labels. Graph labeling refers to several different problems of assigning labels to graphs subject to certain constraints. See also graph coloring, in which the labels are interpreted as colors.
<<leaf>> 1.  A leaf vertex or pendant vertex (especially in a tree) is a vertex whose degree is  1. A leaf edge or pendant edge is the edge connecting a leaf vertex to its single neighbour.
<<length>> In an unweighted graph, the length of a cycle, path, or walk is the number of edges it uses. In a weighted graph, it may instead be the sum of the weights of the edges that it uses. Length is used to define the shortest path, girth (shortest cycle length), and longest path between two vertices in a graph.
<<level>> 1.  This is the /depth/ of a node plus 1, although some ^{[12]} define it instead to be synonym of /depth/. A node's level in a rooted tree is the number of nodes in the path from the root to the node. For instance, the root has level 1 and any one of its adjacent nodes has level 2.

<<linkage>> A synonym for degeneracy.
<<list>> 1.  An adjacency list is a computer representation of graphs for use in graph algorithms.
<<local>> A local property of a graph is a property that is determined only by the neighbourhoods of the vertices in the graph. For instance, a graph is locally finite if all of its neighborhoods are finite.
<<loop>> A loop or self-loop is an edge both of whose endpoints are the same vertex. It forms a cycle of length 1. These are not allowed in simple graphs.
<<magnification>> Synonym for vertex expansion.
<<matching>> A matching is a set of edges in which no two share any vertex. A vertex is matched or saturated if it is one of the endpoints of an edge in the matching. A perfect matching or complete matching is a matching that matches every vertex; it may also be called a 1-factor, and can only exist when the order is even. A near-perfect matching, in a graph with odd order, is one that saturates all but one vertex. A maximum matching is a matching that uses as many edges as possible; the matching number /α/′( /G/) of a graph G is the number of edges in a maximum matching. A maximal matching is a matching to which no additional edges can be added.
<<maximal>> 1.  A subgraph of given graph G is maximal for a particular property if it has that property but no other supergraph of it that is also a subgraph of G also has the same property. That is, it is a maximal element of the subgraphs with the property. For instance, a maximal clique is a complete subgraph that cannot be expanded to a larger complete subgraph. The word "maximal" should be distinguished from "maximum": a maximum subgraph is always maximal, but not necessarily vice versa.
<<maximum>> A subgraph of a given graph G is maximum for a particular property if it is the largest subgraph (by order or size) among all subgraphs with that property. For instance, a maximum clique is any of the largest cliques in a given graph.

<<minor>> A graph H is a minor of another graph G if H can be obtained by deleting edges or vertices from G and contracting edges in G. It is a shallow minor if it can be formed as a minor in such a way that the subgraphs of G that were contracted to form vertices of H all have small diameter. H is a topological minor of G if G has a subgraph that is a subdivision of H. A graph is H-minor-free if it does not have H as a minor. A family of graphs is minor-closed if it is closed under minors; the Robertson--Seymour theorem characterizes minor-closed families as having a finite set of forbidden minors.
<<mixed>> A mixed graph is a graph that may include both directed and undirected edges.
<<modular>> 1.   Modular graph, a graph in which each triple of vertices has at least one median vertex that belongs to shortest paths between all pairs of the triple.

<<path decomposition>> A path decomposition of a graph G is a tree decomposition whose underlying tree is a path. Its width is defined in the same way as for tree decompositions, as one less than the size of the largest bag. The minimum width of any path decomposition of G is the pathwidth of G.
<<pathwidth>> The pathwidth of a graph G is the minimum width of a path decomposition of G. It may also be defined in terms of the clique number of an interval completion of G. It is always between the bandwidth and the treewidth of G. It is also known as interval thickness, vertex separation number, or node searching number.
<<pendant>> See leaf.
<<perfect>> 1.  A perfect graph is a graph in which, in every induced subgraph, the chromatic number equals the clique number.

<<power>> 1.  A graph power /G/ ^{/k/} of a graph G is another graph on the same vertex set; two vertices are adjacent in /G/ ^{/k/} when they are at distance at most k in G. A leaf power is a closely related concept, derived from a power of a tree by taking the subgraph induced by the tree's leaves.
<<predecessor>> A vertex coming before a given vertex in a directed path.
<<proper>> 1.  A proper subgraph is a subgraph that removes at least one vertex or edge relative to the whole graph; for finite graphs, proper subgraphs are never isomorphic to the whole graph, but for infinite graphs they can be.
<<property>> A graph property is something that can be true of some graphs and false of others, and that depends only on the graph structure and not on incidental information such as labels. Graph properties may equivalently be described in terms of classes of graphs (the graphs that have a given property). More generally, a graph property may also be a function of graphs that is again independent of incidental information, such as the size, order, or degree sequence of a graph; this more general definition of a property is also called an invariant of the graph.

<<recognizable>> In the context of the reconstruction conjecture, a graph property is recognizable if its truth can be determined from the deck of the graph. Many graph properties are known to be recognizable. If the reconstruction conjecture is true, all graph properties are recognizable.
<<reconstruction>> The reconstruction conjecture states that each undirected graph G is uniquely determined by its /deck/, a multiset of graphs formed by removing one vertex from G in all possible ways. In this context, reconstruction is the formation of a graph from its deck.
<<rectangle>> A simple cycle consisting of exactly four edges and four vertices.

<<simple>> 1.  A simple graph is a graph without loops and without multiple adjacencies. That is, each edge connects two distinct endpoints and no two edges have the same endpoints. A simple edge is an edge that is not part of a multiple adjacency. In many cases, graphs are assumed to be simple unless specified otherwise.
<<sink>> A sink, in a directed graph, is a vertex with no outgoing edges (out-degree equals 0).
<<size>> The size of a graph G is the number of its edges, | /E/( /G/)|. ^{[13]} The variable m is often used for this quantity. See also /order/, the number of vertices.
<<small-world network>> A small-world network is a graph in which most nodes are not neighbors of one another, but most nodes can be reached from every other node by a small number of hops or steps. Specifically, a small-world network is defined to be a graph where the typical distance /L/ between two randomly chosen nodes (the number of steps required) grows proportionally to the logarithm of the number of nodes /N/ in the network ^{[14]}
<<snark>> A snark is a simple, connected, bridgeless cubic graph with chromatic index equal to 4.

The edge space is the space of all sets of edges, and the vertex space is the space of all sets of vertices. The cut space is a subspace of the edge space that has the cut-sets of the graph as its elements. The cycle space has the Eulerian spanning subgraphs as its elements.

Variations include geometric spanners, graphs whose vertices are points in a geometric space; tree spanners, spanning trees of a graph whose distances approximate the graph distances, and graph spanners, sparse subgraphs of a dense graph whose distances approximate the original graph's distances. A greedy spanner is a graph spanner constructed by a greedy algorithm, generally one that considers all edges from shortest to longest and keeps the ones that are needed to preserve the distance approximation.
<<spanning>> A subgraph is spanning when it includes all of the vertices of the given graph. Important cases include spanning trees, spanning subgraphs that are trees, and perfect matchings, spanning subgraphs that are matchings. A spanning subgraph may also be called a factor, especially (but not only) when it is regular.
<<sparse>> A sparse graph is one that has few edges relative to its number of vertices. In some definitions the same property should also be true for all subgraphs of the given graph.

<<tree decomposition>> A tree decomposition of a graph G is a tree whose nodes are labeled with sets of vertices of G; these sets are called bags. For each vertex v, the bags that contain v must induce a subtree of the tree, and for each edge uv there must exist a bag that contains both u and v. The width of a tree decomposition is one less than the maximum number of vertices in any of its bags; the treewidth of G is the minimum width of any tree decomposition of G.
<<treewidth>> The treewidth of a graph G is the minimum width of a tree decomposition of G. It can also be defined in terms of the clique number of a chordal completion of G, the order of a haven of G, or the order of a bramble of G.
